            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I will not trouble thee with the cauſe of my writing or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing, ſince I haue witneſſes enough for my iuſtifiable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in both.

            <p>For my ſincerity in anſwering I haue thus much to teſtifie. 1. that I haue vſed no carnall ſhifts or colourable evaſions, but wholly <hi>grounded on the good word of God.</hi> 2. <hi>my method</hi> will teſtifie, which wholy tends to the credit &amp; advantage of our brethrens cauſe. 3 my fidelity will teſtifie <hi>in producing all which they wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

then (I ſuppoſe) any of them haue ſeene. 4. the learned will teſtifie, to whoſe iudgement &amp; correction I haue already ſubmitted my ſelfe. 5. my brethren may teſtifie, in ſome part, whoſe conferences and diſputations I haue been ſo farr from declining, that (vpon their owne appointments and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers) I haue waited for them in vaine. 6. the Lord will teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, to whome I haue beene carefull, in all the proceedings which I haue made, in ſome comfortable meaſure to approoue my conſcience.</p>
            <p>For my plaineſſe I need not much excuſe my ſelfe. I deale with men who write in the plaineſt manner; alſo the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (being of humble kneeling) is <hi>Argumentum humile.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides I thought it needfull, partly by reaſon of the ignorance, partly the diſpoſition of the common ſort, (deſpiſing any thing that is not within their owne vnderſtanding, calling it <hi>braine-knowledge)</hi> to deale with them, as it were, by familiar com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.</p>
            <p>If any man thinke I haue not written <hi>mildly</hi> enough, I ſay with Mr. <hi>Cart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r. They muſt not thinke much to be ſtrucken with the backe, who haue ſtricken others with the edge.</hi> I ſay further, ſometimes they deliver ſuch ſilly or vnchriſtian points, (as the Diſp. about coheires, &amp;c.) that it was needfull to anſwer with ſome rebuke. Yet proteſting, for our brethren, who are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe wiſe and godly men, I loue them in the bowells of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Of my Reader I heartily requeſt, that he would cover my overſights and infirmities with the mantle of loue; and if he be ſcrupulous that he would not ſuffer himſelfe to be foreſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: that he would pleaſe to take the paines to reade through, not being diſcouraged with the rude and haſty generalls in the firſt part: that he would ſet himſelfe to conſider what I reaſon or anſwer, and how the force of obiections is taken away: that if he can be ſatified, he would not be aſhamed of men, or afraid of diſeſteeme of the world; but giue God his glory, the Church her due, and gaine vnto himſelfe the ſweete advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of frequent communicating, and finally make vp the breach, to the end we may more ſweetly ioyne againſt the common Adverſaries of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14577:6"/>
The practiſe of two ſorts of men I vtterly abhor: 1. of them which being themſelues vile and prophane, ſhould hence take occaſion to reproach our brethren for profeſſing to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of their wayes. I will be no encourager of ſuch wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches whoſe caſe is miſerable and damnable, whiles the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities (ſuch as the beſt men haue) of them which ſtriue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely to know the truth, and walke according to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſhall never be imputed to their condemnation. 2. Of them who will be cenſurers though no readers, ſpeaking evill of the things they know not; or if they reade, reade but to ſcoffe and cavill, having not a ſpark of good iudgement, diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or charity: I looke for many ſuch, but we muſt all ſtand before the iudgement ſeat of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, to thoſe perſons that can be contented to take it at my hands I would giue this counſell. 1. To thinke as they would be thought of, to ſpeake as they would be ſpoken of. to doe as they would be done to. 2. To conſider, that it is not knowne that any Chriſtian ſince the world was created, hath ſuffered trouble in confeſſion againſt kneeling to God in his holy ordinance.</p>

And my meaning is partly with implicit worſhip, when the body guided by the ſoule attends vnto the ſervice of God, without reſpect of its poſiture: partly when ſome one or other ſpeciall geſture is of purpoſe applyed, for the due performance of the holy ordinances of Chriſt. A worſhip-ordinance, wherein both ſoule and body ſtand bound, cannot be conſidered without a worſhipping geſture: for as the ſervice of the ſoule conſiſts in inward faculties and their actions: ſo that of the body ſtands and is declared by the members and geſtures. It is true, that the geſture both in the ſame and ſeverall worſhipps continually varieth, but the variation takes not away the reſpect of worſhip in the geſture; for as the geſture varies, the expreſſion of worſhip varies, but ſo ſtill worſhip-expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in other geſtures remaineth. That which deceiues the vulgar in this thing, is, that becauſe ſtanding and ſitting, are (in ordinary vſe) civill geſtures, they think therefore they cannot be geſtures of worſhip. But they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14577:9"/>
conſider not; that kneeling it ſelfe is a civill geſture, as well as ſtanding and ſitting, if it be applied to civill occaſions<hi>:</hi> and ſo, ſtanding and ſitting be religious geſtures as well as kneeling, if they be <note n="b" place="margin">Though ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting bee in it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Geſtures are ſaid to be geſtures of worſhip in a generall ſenſe, on more ſpeciall. Firſt, ſome geſtures be called geſtures of worſhip onely, becauſe they be ſitting pofitions of the body for receiving of Gods ordinance<hi>:</hi> ſitting in the exerciſe of the word is ſuch<hi>:</hi> for looke what geſture is by vs at any time conveniently applyed to the due cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of holy duties, the ſame is doubtleſſe a bodily worſhipping; inaſmuch as thereby the body joynes with the ſoule in religious performance. It is true that the word [worſhip] in Scripture is frequently reſtrained vnto prayer and thankſgiving; but that no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ſitting or ſtanding in the exerciſe of the word to be worſhip-geſtures, then the exerciſe of the word it ſelfe to be a worſhip-ordinance. But, ſecondly, ſome geſtures againe be called geſtures of worſhip in a more ſpeciall reſpect of adoring; as by baring or bowing of the head; by bowing of the body; either by incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or proſtration, &amp;c. And where the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes mention of worſhip, it commonly meanes ſome ſuch humble geſture, (as alſo the originall ſignifles, which afterwards I will ſhew.) Yea the Scripture ſometimes expreſſely contradiſtin guiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the word [worſhipping] to the exerciſe of the word; as, <hi>one fourth part of the day they read and heard the word of the Lord; another fourth part of the day they confeſſed and worſhipped,</hi> Nehemiah. 9. 3.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14577:15"/>
a ſtrong probability of ſtanding implied in that law. Thus ſhall ye eate it, with your loynes girded, your ſhooes on your feete, your ſtaffe in your hand, and ye ſhall eate it in haſt; It is the Lords Paſſeover, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 11.

But becauſe I am reſolved to reſt in no vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or halfe proofes, I will take another view of the geſtures of the Paſſeover againe, and of the proofes which we haue mentioned vnto them ſeverally. Firſt, for ſtanding at the Paſſeover, the practiſe of the Prieſts was no patterne for the children of Iſrael; for their ſtanding was occaſionally neceſſary for their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and miniſtry about the Paſſeover it ſelfe, and the Paſſeover-offerings.

Secondly, for ſitting, let it be, that our Saviour, and his Diſciples ſate at the Paſſeover, what was that to the direction of any Iew for the geſture of ſitting, for the ſpace of aboue fifteene hundred yeeres together before that time? nay Chriſts ſitting was not vſefull vnto the Iewes at all, who is never ſaid to ſit at the Paſſeover, till that time when he did quite and for ever aboliſh the vſe of it: So to them it was vnlawfull to eate a Paſſeover any more after this, which our Saviour is ſaid to haue celebrated in ſitting. Thirdly, for proſtration let it be, that the Scripture yeelds no particular inſtance of it, in the act of eating the Lambe; what followeth of all this? verily thus much; that the Iewes from the time that the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:14577:15"/>
was inſtituted, to the time that it was aboliſhed, had no commandement, no example, no mention of any geſture in the Paſſeouer but that of their Prieſts, which concerned them not, but was proper onely to themſelues, becauſe of their office of Prieſt-hood.

It is falſe therefore that the Abridgement <note n="a" place="margin">Abridg. pag. 56.</note> would inſinuate, that there is precept for receiving of ſome Sacrament ſitting. But more to our purpoſe for ſitting at the Communion, the matter is plaine enough that there is no commandement: Chriſt bids his Church in the inſtitution, to eate bread, and drinke wine, in remembrance of his death, but not to receiue thoſe elements in the geſture of ſitting.</p>

To ſpeake my minde in this thing; I ſuppoſe a ſupper in our vſe of the word, is a competent meale, and to call them three Suppers to the common people, makes them to muſe and maruell what ſhould bee the matter.

mine eye rather to the inſtitution of the Paſſeouer, which was commanded to bee eaten <note n="f" place="margin">Exod. 12. 8.</note> with bitter hearbes, which this ſoppe or ſauce, or whatſoeuer it was, was probably made of. I doe perſwade my ſelfe, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour CHRIST and the Apoſtles did eate of this ſop, before he roſe from the Table to waſh his Diſciples feet, (though it bee not mentioned before, nor had beene at all, but by the occaſion of <hi>Judas</hi> dipping) and that this eating after was but a continuation of the Paſchall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in eating both of the fleſh and hearbes; which ſtands with much better reaſon, then for the mention of a meere ſop or ſauce (which might very well be made (partly at leaſt) of the inſtituted hearbes) to ſet vp another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſupper. Some call the latter a ſecond ſeruice, but they might aſwell call it a diſtinct ſupper, for no ſecond ſeruice belonged to the Paſchall ſupper. wherein the fleſh, and the hearbes were to bee eaten together. I but what ſhall bee ſaid to <hi>Iohn,</hi> 13. 2. Supper being done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he roſe, and ſate, and eate afterwards againe.

Alſo I ſee not the conceite of common ſuppers in the old teſtament ſo much as intimated; nay, the Paſchal lambe was appointed to be ſupper enough of it ſelfe, for if it were too much for one family, neighbour houſes might ioyne, and if notwithſtanding, any of it were left till morning, it was to bee burned with fire, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. 10.

I adde, that a juſt collation of the Euangeliſts will euince that there was but one Supper. And laſtly, it was moſt like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Euchariſticall ſupper was eaten next the Paſchall, into whoſe roome it immediately tooke place. And ſurely the diſtinction by a common Supper would darken to the Apoſtles the cleereneſſe of the ſucceſſion of it.

Let no man be ſo vaine, to object here the Sacraments which Chriſt inſtituted, for they be neceſſaries, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantialls; the geſture is onely a neceſſary meane in its kind, but variouſly determinable, for the fitting celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them.</p>

If he had continued vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth to receiue this Sacrament among his Diſciples, by it ſelfe, without the conjunction of any other meale, it is hard to ſay then, what geſture he might haue vſed: he might haue kneeled, or ſtood, as well as ſate, for ought I know. No other geſture is ſtoryed but ſitting, (ſuppoſing that in this Paragraph) becauſe our Saviour received the Sacrament no other time but once. Verily if ſitting were never ſo variable, no other maine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture could be practiſed with it at the ſame time. He muſt either ſtand, or ſit, or kneele, or lye downe. You will confeſſe, in proceſſe of time he might haue taught his Apoſtles and others to ſtand, and I will ſay likewiſe, he might haue taught them to kneele. Well, this is all, I would propoſe to your thoughes, that our Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting the Sacrament could vſe but one geſture that time, but this excludes not other geſtures, which had beene mutually and interchangeably variable from the beginning. And marke this well, that no doubt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour would haue put a note of immutability vpon his geſture, if he meane to put vpon vs the ſtrict imitation of it; conſidering no geſture was obligatory in the Church by example, nay I ſay, not ſo much as (abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely)

So a tranſlatour followes his authour, if he keepe his true meaning, though he doe not ſervily bind himſelfe to his words. Now the meaning of mutable circumſtances is fetched from the equity of them. Therefore I ſwerue not from Chriſts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample even in the geſture of kneeling, if kneeling hold proportion with the equity of his ſitting. Thus you pleaſe to <note n="q" place="margin">Manuſcrip. ch. 2.</note> plead for your <hi>ſtanding;</hi> that the Church in vſing it, doth not ſwerue from the example of Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles: for though it be not the ſame geſture (you ſay) that they vſed, yet it is well knowne to be of the ſame kind theirs was [that is] for equity; and that equity, (as I noted before) is fitneſſe to vſe a table-geſture.] But then if our equity be as good as yours (which muſt be tryed in it owne place) you will take vs into your company of not ſwerving from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles.

For the third, one man may haue ſome reſerved and peculiar end to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in holy worſhip, which another hath not; inward, in reſpect of particular diſpoſition of heart, through the apprehenſion of ſome mercy received, ſome want vnſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, ſome luſt vnmortified; and outward, for edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others, in regard of their perſons; in regard alſo of times, and places; and other circumſtances occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. Doe you looke for an harmony of the Apoſtles themſelues in theſe things? verily you ſhall not finde it. It is enough, that we all conſent in the ſubſtantialls, which are expreſſely manifeſted: as for meaſure, and outward manner, and ſome particular end, which to ſome man ſpecially occurreth, you ſhall be forced to generall rules in plaine deſpight of you: now to apply this, the difference of circumſtances is occaſioned either from the ſtate of the ſoule, (which like a ſeale maketh (as it will) impreſſion vpon our bodies;) or from the ſtate of the Church whereof we be members; the <note n="g" place="margin">Cot. 11. v. 14.</note> cuſtome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

Now if I aſſume, that the geſture is circumſtantiall to the Sacrament, and ſo of the nature of other circumſtances, which you grant be variable, I hope, I doe not begg it of you. If I take it not, <hi>ex con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſo;</hi> yet I take it, <hi>ex probate;</hi> as judge you: ſo that whiles you doe tell vs, that ſome circumſtances were varied by the Apoſtles, what doth that hurt vs concerning the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture?

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>79</label> the ſtrength of our argument from thoſe circumſtances by this anſwer. We reaſon in this manner; becauſe time, number, ſex, &amp;c. were changeable [yea changed by the Apoſtles, for ſo this is an illuſtration of our proofe] then the geſture, which from the begining of the world hath been varied aſwell as other circumſtances in all parts of Gods worſhip, may be here varied aſwell.

                     <p>Secondly, (they <note n="p" place="margin">

I Anſwer. Firſt if he had in many things ſpeciall reaſon (as you ſay) yet ſo long as he had it not in them all, it makes not againſt the geſture, though there was no ſpeciall reaſon for it. That he had not ſpeciall reaſon in all the circumſtances, (I thinke) you will not deny; as in the receiuers communicating of the bread and cup one with another, in the quantity of bread and wine receiued by them; in ſitting together (as you ſay) at one table; in ſitting in the act of bleſſing; and in the act of deliuering; &amp;c. If therefore there be no ſpeciall reaſon of Chriſts geſture, yet the ſame may be changed, as well as theſe things are by your ſelues.</p>

Thirdly, finally what ſay you to the adminiſtration of the ſupper?

Here kneeling is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined dangerouſly: if therefore ſtanding is to be borne with, rather then kneeling; kneeling alſo may be borne, though the degree of inconvenience be greater. Secondly, if you ſay ſtanding is better then kneeling, that is, an inconvenience is better then a ſinne, what is that to the Biſhops <hi>dilemma:</hi> [if ſtanding be admitted, why doe you preſſe Chriſts example of ſitting? if Chriſts ſitting be neceſſary, why doe you vſe ſtanding?] where that kneeling is a ſinne muſt needs be begged in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with ſtanding, when Chriſts geſture was no more ſtanding then kneeling: therefore this ſalue heales not your ſore (common with vs) of ſwerving from Chriſts example: eſpecially firſt, when you doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſtand in many places, when you might ſit, and in <hi>Geneva</hi> they ſtand altogether<hi>:</hi> this is ſtrange magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſts example. Secondly, when (you <note n="l" place="margin">

Chriſts example, yea a palpable breaking of it? but let Mr. Replier <note n="o" place="margin">Repl partic to Bp. <hi>Merion,</hi> pag. 36.</note> helpe you at a dead lift: firſt, (ſaith he) <hi>walking is more agreeable to a ſupper then kneeling:</hi> but what doth he ſpeake of kneeling without cauſe, he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend that walking breakes not Chriſts example of ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: he onely makes compariſon with kneeling for an evaſion: for what if walking be afarre off agreeable to a ſupper, what is that to Chriſts example, except that your ſinne of breaking his example may perhaps be leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened? and yet that is nothing to the very point. Now how agreeable walking is to a ſupper, that ſhall we ſhew in its owne <note n="p" place="margin">Afterward chap 5.</note> place.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, ſaith the Replier, <hi>walking was never abuſed to idolatry, as kneeling.</hi> Anſwer, ſtill he evades by compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <label type="milestone">

It is as if you ſhould haue ſaid in this manner<hi>:</hi> we may leaue Chriſts example for any geſture that is not idolatrous: and this is the true application of your comparatiue anſwere. You haue brought the plea of Chriſts example to a worthy good paſſe; for ſo kneeling it ſelfe is lawfull you confeſſe for all Chriſts example in it ſelfe, if idolatry had not (as you ſay) polluted it.

Secondly, beggarly: firſt, begging that walking is as neere Chriſts example as you can come. Secondly, but ſhamefully begging, that walking is no ſin, is againſt Chriſts example which was objected

The Biſhop <note n="q" place="margin">B. <hi>Mort.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence partic. chap 3. ſect 7.</note> chargeth you with offending againſt Chriſts example (if it be a ſin not to follow it in geſture) by your walking vp and down: you anſwer, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, that <hi>you are forced to walke indeed, but you abſteine in the meane time from that which is euill, that you do not ſin in it.</hi> But I pray why did you not ſhew and prooue, that you ſin not againſt Chriſts example by walking, hould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the geſture of kneeling as you doe. Loe, Sir, (pray you looke againe) that was the point, (and yet is) to be anſwered: as for your ſaying, you come as neere Chriſts example as you can, that ſatisfies nothing at all, if your geſture be a ſweruing from Chriſts example; and ſo be a ſinne in it ſelfe vnto you: your comming as neere as you can, may excuſe perhaps <hi>a tanto,</hi> but it doth not excuſe and releaſe <hi>(a tot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THirdly, our order brings vs now to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> of the arguments drawne from nature: and indeed the ſtrength is good which the light of <note n="*" place="margin">Authority in another beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth reverence in me, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſoule, breedeth in me a deſire to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt it to the party reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly doe it, by any other meanes, but by ſome bodily ſhadow &amp; ſign; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon nature teacheth me to bow the body: Treat. of div. worſh. pag. 9.</note> nature miniſtreth for the juſt defence of kneeling in the worſhip of God<hi>:</hi> yet it is ſaid, that <hi>knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the act of receiving the Sacramentall elements, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the order of nature.</hi> Now nature hath three wayes whereby ſhe manifeſteth her ſelfe: firſt, thoſe naturall principles, and notions of the minde, which ariſe, <hi>è dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine rationis.</hi> Secondly, the naturall inclination and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſitie of things, whereby they are conſtantly mooved and carried after ſome ſpeciall manner. Thirdly, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and civill exigence of things themſelues, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are adminiſtred, and applyed, as harmony, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, and laſtly, ſenſible commodiouſneſſe and fitneſſe doe require. I am content that nature by theſe wayes be <hi>moderatrix</hi> betwixt vs. Firſt, you cannot deny, that there is a principle in nature for worſhipping God, and that a naturall expreſſion of worſhip is bowing or falling downe. Secondly, you cannot deny that man is prone by nature to adore before the majeſty of God in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, whoſe face he apprehends to be both preſent and glorious. Thirdly, for the neceſſary adminiſtration of Gods worſhip, kneeling will be leaſt condemned by nature among the geſtures: for this I muſt admoniſh you of, that when we aske what geſture nature requireth in the Sacrament, it is not as if we asked what geſture nature requireth in eating &amp; drinking: for thus you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider no more of the Sacrament, then of a civill ſupper at ſome. Therfore becauſe nature knows not Evangelicall Sacraments in the particular accommodation of them, we can inquire no better then what geſture doth nature require, either in a Sacrament (which is a ſeale of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:14577:63"/>
betwixt our Creatour and vs) or more generally what geſture requires it in divine worſhip. So then firſt, Harmony allowes the geſture of kneeling in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment well; <hi>poſito,</hi> that nature doth ſimply &amp; vniverſally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it in worſhipping.

Thirdly, all the matter you ſtand on, is the leaſt of all: and that is the commodiouſneſſe and fitneſſe of ſitting in the time of receiving, and the incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and vnfitneſſe of kneeling at that time: but it will prooue (I hope) vpon juſt triall, that kneeling is commodious and fit as well as are ſitting and ſtanding. That reaſon may ſway, let your arguments be now exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; which I finde to be two in number; one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, one ſpeciall: though the generall be nothing of it ſelfe, but either vaniſheth into the ſpeciall, or into other arguments. The generall argument aſſumeth kneeling to be againſt the order of nature, becauſe it is againſt <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</hi> Wherefore of decency we muſt ſay ſomething.</p>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:14577:63"/>
for you, that the caſe ſhall be tryed betweene vs, as if there were no magiſtrate in the Church. But perhaps you might haue better diſtinguiſhed thus. [There is a towfold decency, either that which you call decency, or that which we call decency] and this would haue beene ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ery purpoſe. But two points I will not ſticke to yeeld you: firſt, that the geſture vſed in the Sacrament ought to be decent, for who is ſovoyd of honeſty to deny that Scripture, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40.) as well as nature, expreſſely impoſing the neceſſity of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t vpon vs? Secondly, that all geſtures be decent in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>perſe,</hi> I meane ſtanding, ſitting, and kneeling; the decency of ſitting doth not exclude the decency of ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, nor doth the decency of both exclude the decency of kneeling, no the decency of kneeling exclude the decency of the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>er. This (I am aſſured) will be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent divinity with you, if I ſhew that there is a decency in kneeling, which is the onely geſture denyed; for of that you <note n="c" place="margin">
                           <hi>Perth. Aſſemb.

But
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:14577:64"/>
(paſſing whether order will not ſtand with the vſage of a new thing) it is falſe, that you ſay, that kneeling at Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a new thing, and ſo that the Sacrament can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be rightly ordered and diſpoſed thereby. Is not the geſture neceſſary in its kind, and may not the particular determination thereof be varyed? and why then doe you tell vs of a new thing inſtituted, which in its kinde is abſolutely neceſſary? and if this be not a good anſwer, how will ſtanding at Sacrament be acquitted from being a new thing, and many things more, which I could name, that be variable, and yet neceſſary in their kinde? would you haue matters of order to be particularly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned? you would and alſo muſt haue it ſo, if by this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning kneeling can poſſibly be condemned<hi>:</hi> but if by new thing you cannot meane any ſuch thing whoſe kinde is neceſſary to the Sacrament, it followeth, that this reaſon againſt kneeling is not worth a ſtraw.

What? doe you leaue Chriſts decency, and take to a decency of your owne? Thirdly, You are certaine that the Apoſtles did not kneele in the act of receiving, or elſe you cannot tell?

                        </gap>t it is but leſſe decent, ſo it is not ſimply indecent therefore. Thirdly, That the ſoule (according to nature) doth vary bodily expreſſions, and geſtures, and is diverſe in them; inſomuch that both all geſtures may be interchanged to the ſame man as his ſoule may be diverſly affected at ſeuerall times, and and alſo that divers men (diverſly diſpoſed) may vſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of bodily geſtures.

                        <hi>ſitting in prayer is an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and vnreverent geſture, if we may conveniently kneele.</hi> For (that I may make ſome criticiſmes vpon this learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,) firſt, haue you ſo good opinion of ſitting, when you come to God in prayer, that you count it vnreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and rudenes; and can you be ſo hot for defence of it (as if there were none to it) when you come to God in ſome other divine ordinance? This ſeemes not to cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Secondly, will you vſe a geſture that is indecent and vnreuerent in prayer, when you want (but ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) convenience to vſe a better? and will you not kneele though it were indecent and vnreverent, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing, when you cannot conveniently, (and perhaps ſometimes poſſibly) vſe a better? I ſuppoſe your anſwer will be to ſeeke, (Sir.) Nay do you not by your ſpeech quite deſtroy the force of your argument againſt knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, drawne from the indecency of it, in aſmuch as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent geſture may be vſed ſometimes, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience ſerveth not to vſe ſome other and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</p>

But I need not that helpe, hauing prooued (I ſuppoſe) before, that kneeling in the very act of receiuing is a decent &amp; a comely geſture. Thus much of their generall argument drawne from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, now followes the ſpeciall argument, which is that of the table-geſture, in handling whereof I beſeech the Lord to lead me by his holy Spirit, that I may faithfully and impartially anſwer the very truth.</p>

Secondly, you ſay, <hi>Chriſt vſed a table-geſture:</hi> and yet you <note n="e" place="margin">Chap. 3.

If your divinity and conſcience would not ſerue you to periſh ſo, but would allow that the table-geſture of ciuill ſuppers might be changed into kneeling in this caſe: why then ſhould kneeling at Sacrament be held vnlawfull in a caſe of much greater importances: wherefore if the cuſtome of the Countrey either by the mind of the inhabitants, or elſe by authority of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power may be turned into kneeling, as we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully yeeld, ſurely it ſinks not into my head, how knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Lords Supper is vnlawfull in it ſelfe, that is

                     <p>In this place I will bring in certaine anſwers made by <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>45</label> our brethren vnto all theſe particular points at once. Firſt, <hi>The reaſon of a feast or banquet is not vſed,</hi> (ſaith the <note n="i" place="margin">Pag. 37.</note> Replyer) <hi>to inferre all the faſhions of a banquet, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue thoſe faſhions, which agree not to any banquet.</hi> I reply two things. Firſt, if you inferre a banquet-geſture from the reſpect of a banquet affirmatiuely, you muſt inferre other faſhions of banquetting likewiſe; eſpecially which are of as much force and vſe to a banquet as is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. for elſe how will you make a ſillogiſme for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he proofe of ſitting? What meane will you make your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion out off? you cannot make an argument taken from feaſts, which will conclude for ſitting, and exclude
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:14577:79"/>
ſuch faſhions of feaſting as I haue named before<hi>:</hi> As for Mr. Diſputers [accompliſhed interteinment] ſolemnity of the feaſt [worthines of the gueſts] [honourable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinment] courteſie of the invitant as much as the nature of feaſting requireth] and I know not how many more ſuch like] what can Mr. Replyer ſay vnto them? how ſhall not other faſhions of feaſts as well as ſitting be inforced from them? Secondly, if you would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue all faſhions which agree not to a banquet, why doe you, (or will you, if neceſſitie ſhould require) accept of ſuch faſhions as I haue noted before, which would be counted ſhamefull and vile, even in an ordinarie ſupper? I pray you looke backe againe vnto them: whereby appeareth, (that I ſay no more) your anſwere is altogether void of judgement.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Mr. Diſputer would anſwere perhaps, that <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>46</label> ſome faſhions of the ſupper are perſonall, and ſome are ſomething elſe what he will. I gather ſo much out of him by his reſtreining of the liberties of a table (which he ſpeakes of) by calling them <note n="k" place="margin">Diſp. pag. 27, &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>[perſonall]</hi> liberties, whereby he would ſeeme perhaps to import, that though the liberties and faſhions of a feaſt (as it were proper to the feaſt ſeparately conſidered) doe not bind vs: yet the diſtinct liberties and faſhions of his perſon who feaſteth, and eateth, doe. I am almoſt of opinion that he ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered at ſome ſuch matter, when he ſpeakes ſo oft, and ſo confidently of [perſonall] liberties. Well, if hee will make vs ſuch an anſwere, I replie three things: firſt, it is a deviſed ſhift, which hath no footing in the booke of God: where will you make appeare, that civill faſhions are to be reteined, not which belong to the feaſt proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but which belong to the man feaſting? Secondly, it is an vnreaſonable ſhift, which will bide no triall: for if the Lords Supper be a feaſt properly ſo called, and that the liberties and faſhions of civill feaſts are therein to be ſtood vpon; ſhall the faſhions of the perſon be teteined <hi>(propter convivium)</hi> for the feaſt ſake; and ſhall not the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:14577:80"/>
faſhions of the feaſt it ſelfe be reteined much more? Thirdly, conſider of thoſe faſhions which I haue obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before, and you ſhall finde it is a fruitleſſe anſwere. For as in the Lords Supper you like and take vnto ſome libertie of civill [feaſts themſelues,] ſo againe your ſelues doe refuſe or omit ſome ſuch libertie, which are [perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall] as it ſeemeth good vnto you<hi>:</hi> and therefore why would you blind our eyes by the name and pretence of perſonall liberties of civill feaſts at the Lords table? Theſe things I note againſt the flouriſh of [perſonall liberties] if you meant by [perſonall] to diſtinguiſh from other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the ſupper it ſelfe. If you meant no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to what purpoſe ſerved that Epithete? good men ſhould not vſe termes to import, or carry ſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ignorant Readers of that which is not.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, both Mr. Replier and Mr. Diſputer anſwer, <note n="l" place="margin">Reply partic. to B. <hi>Mort.</hi> p. 37 Diſp. pag. 148.</note>

                        <hi>Though all faſhions of a banquet may not here be vſed, yet thoſe which may be iuſtified by Chriſts owne example, ought not to be excluded.</hi> I anſwere, firſt, now you quite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime the proper force of the table-geſture reaſon, and onelie betake you to Chriſts example; for ſuch and ſuch faſhions muſt be vſed not which the nature of a feaſt warranteth, but which Chriſts example onely warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, let reaſonable men judge what dealing and daubing this is. Secondly, the defence of Chriſts example wee haue ſeene before faine to flie hither for refuge, I meane to the reaſon of a table-geſture<hi>:</hi> and how then ſhall that miniſter enterteinment to this, when it ſeekes to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteined and ſheltered vnder the authority of it? I hope this hath beene found true in its owne place. Thirdly, why haue you abuſed vs all this while, to reaſon from a Countrey cuſtome immediately, haue you ſpent many ſheets of paper about ſolemnity of the feaſt, worthineſſe of the gueſts, accompliſhed and honourable entertein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, courteſie of the in vitant, &amp;c. and will you caſt off the reaſon of civill eating and drinking now? nay moreover (you <note n="m" place="margin">Diſp. pag. 28.</note> ſay) that <hi>Chriſt was</hi> 
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Good Reader marke this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, I pray.</note> 
                        <hi>tyed to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions</hi>
                        <pb n="147" facs="tcp:14577:80"/>
                        <hi>of feaſts by three things: firſt, by a iuſt expectancy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of on the part of the invited. Secondly, by the proper nature and intendment of a feaſt. Thirdly, by a direct intimation and profeſſion from himſelfe to performe them, in that he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh the ſolemnizing of a feaſt.</hi> And will you ſhake off this deepe divinitie now when you be put to ſhift for anſwere. Fourthlie, where you flie to Chriſts example for table-faſhions, be mindfull of this advertiſement, that both you vſe ſome faſhions of eating which Chriſt vſed not, and ſome which Chriſt vſed you be contented to let paſſe. This you cannot deny<hi>:</hi> and therefore to what purpoſe (becauſe of Chriſts example) doe you ſtriue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the neceſſitie of a table-geſture.</p>
                     <p>Thus I haue ſatisfied (I ſuppoſe) ſuch anſwers or ſhifts <label type="milestone">

To this Mr. Diſputer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers <note n="u" place="margin">Diſp. pag. 146, 147.</note> like a Skilfull man, <hi>that there is great difference betwixt ſitting at a feaſt and vncouering:</hi> and what is that difference betwixt them? By ſitting we are admited re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the table ſaith he. It is falſe you are not admitted ſimply by ſitting; for if you carre to it by ſtanding or any other geſture: you are admitted to the table; onely by ſitting you are admited with more credit and conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; So are you alſo by being couered.

Againe (ſaith he) by ſitting we giue and receiue interteinment at the table: and are you ſo vncivilly faſhioned, or ſo vnacquainted with the Country manner, that you do not know we do giue, and receiue interteinment at the table by the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and commoditie of our ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Surely the Diſputer hath forgotten himſelfe. Againe (ſaith he) our ſocietie with Chriſt in glory is noted in Scripture by ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at a table, ſo is it not by covering of the head: as if the Holy Ghoſt is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I anſwere, firſt, if there be ſuch a cuſtome among them, what is that to vs? we muſt be ruled by our owne Country cuſtome, not by theirs in our geſtures at Sacrament, for ſo you ſay often enough, and if you will giue leaue to trie the controverſie by the libertie of all Countrey cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes aſwell as our owne, I could ſhew that your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is yet more fantaſticall. Secondly, but ſuppoſe our owne Countrey faſhion were, that waiters were covered aſwell as thoſe they waited vpon, whats that to the point? It is enough that ſuch as ſit at table be couered, (which is onely to the matter i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But I pray you Sir. Muſt you needes haue a geſture to difference gueſts from waiters? Then (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that it is on idle divice of your owne heart) what will you ſay to the geſture of ſtanding, which you vſe
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:14577:82"/>
in receiuing ſometimes, which is the notorious gueſture of ſuch as waite at table? nay how fooliſh is it to ſtand vpon the difference, when at the Sacrament there be no waiters (properly ſo called from civill vſe) for they be all gueſts which be preſent? Laſtly (ſaith he) in our Sauiour Chriſts time, there was no ornament for the head in vſe; that is ſtrange when the Apoſtle <note n="w" place="margin">1 Cor. 114. See Dan. 3. 21.</note> forbids men to be covered in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but ſuppoſe there was not, yet ſo long as if it had beene the faſhion of the <hi>Iewes</hi> at meat (you will ſay) Chriſt would not then haue refuſed it, it ſerveth enough for our turne. Beſides, if Chriſt were vncovered it was occaſionall, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eerely civill; your vncovering is vſed of purpoſe and choyce: and (as yourſelues do ſay) for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious reverence. And yet there is no doubt but in thoſe times they vſed coverings vnto the head, even our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and his Apoſtles did which the neceſſitie of ſhelter from injuries both of cold and heat did bring into vſe from the beginning. Thus then I may ſtill apply my three former points, for reply to your threefould gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall anſwere as before. <label type="milestone">

                     <p>Thirteenthly (or fourthly) I offer to your judgement and cenſure, whether ſtanding (to ſpeake of it diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) ought not to be refuſed alſo at the Lords Supper as well as any of the former.

But ſhall I therefore call this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacticall geſturing a proper table-geſture, in civill and ſolemne eating? Secondly, conſider that ſitting is a perſonall liberty of gueſts at table, yea ſuch a liberty, as that you <note n="y" place="margin">Repl. partic. to Bp. <hi>Mort.</hi> p. 36.</note> ſay, <hi>it is a ſacramentall and eſſentiall part of the inſtitution.</hi> And therefore you ſhould hold your ſelues

                     <p>Fourteenthly (or fifthly) I offer to your judgement and cenſure, whether walking vp and downe ought not to be refuſed for vnlawfull, as well as kneeling.

But (I pray) in what reſpect is walking agreeable to a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? becauſe the body is higher in the aire? or becauſe it is good for digeſtion of meate? or becauſe we come to ſupper by walking? or laſtly, becauſe the drudges of an houſe be wont to eate ſometimes perhaps, whiles they goe vp and downe a ſweeping: or ſome ſervitours at table eate ſometimes, as they goe vp and downe, when they haue changed a trencher? other agreeableneſſe beſides of walking to a feaſt or ſupper I know none.

For the antecedent you can never prooue that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a proper, and direct reſemblance of heauenly glory; for in ſuch a type or reſemblance there be three points concurring.

                     <p>Firſt, (ſaies the <note n="h" place="margin">Repl. partic. to Bp. <hi>Mort.</hi> p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 39.</note> Replier) it is very probable, that <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> this ſupper is a type of the heavenly glory; becauſe Chriſt often reſembles the ſame by a ſupper: eſpecially this ſupper being a type of ſomething. Anſwer, this laſt clauſe is very childiſh and idle, in aſmuch as Chriſt hath expreſſly pointed out vnto vs that thing which this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is to repreſent. Againe, the force of your reaſon is common to all civill ſuppers aſwell as to the Sacrament, nay it is more for them then this; becauſe they be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers properly taken, wheras this is not, there being no accompliſhed point of a ſupper, or feaſt, to be found in it at all: moreover, this reaſon is deliuered but as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, and I hope conjectures will ſway no mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; but what if there were never ſo great a fitnes and correſpondence of this ſupper to the heavenly, it could be yet no type either ſpeciall, or inſtituted; this reaſoning therefore is very ſhallow and fruitles, and this is more then probable.</p>

of grace? is this the way rightly to finde out, and judge of proper types? from my riſing out of bed, I take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to thinke of the finall reſurrection of all fleſh out of their graues. Is my riſing therefore a proper type of the reſurrection? If this reaſon can make a type, then any thing vpon earth may be made a type, of ſome hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly thing, if thence we can but raiſe our thoughts to the contemplation of ſome ſuch thing which is heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of our communion with Chriſt, ſtands in the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall imbracings ond reflections of loue and grace, at Chriſt <note n="l" place="margin">Reuel. 3. 20.</note> ſpeaketh. <hi>If any man open the doore I will come into him, and will ſup with him, and he with me.</hi> Glory is no more perceining to this communion, then is a rich dowry to the communion of man &amp; wife. Beſides by this learning of yours you do plainely jumble together the ſignification of all types: therefore the ſame concludes not the Sacrament to be a type of heaven, either imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, or ſpeciall, or inſtitued.</p>
                     <p>Fourthlie (ſaies <note n="m" place="margin">Pag. as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note> the Replier) <hi>In other Sacramen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        <hi>of ſomething which is to come; and why ſhould there not bee likewiſe in the Lords Supper?</hi> Anſwer. I anſwer, firſt for the Paſſeover, and then joyntly for Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion and Baptiſme. And for that I ſay, that the two ſignifications therein of [paſt] and [to come]
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:14577:88"/>
doe in our Sacrament meete together in one; which is a remembrance of the Lambe alreadie ſlaine for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance. Therefore if you would make any juſt analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie betwixt the Paſſeover, (concerning its ſignifying ſomething to come) and the Euchariſticall ſupper, you ſhould compare the ſame in this manner: that as the Paſſeover ſignified the Lambe <hi>to be</hi> ſlaine, our Supper ſignifies the Lambe <hi>already</hi> ſlaine<hi>:</hi> and how is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the Supper muſt needs now ſignifie ſomething to come, becauſe the Paſſeover ſignified Chriſt to come. Verily you do not reply with judgement, if you pleaſe to giue me leaue ſo to admoniſh you: nay becauſe you can not ſhew anie glorie to come, which the Paſſeover was a type of, it followes that the Supper is type of no glorie to come; for there is as much reaſon, that, that ſhould ſignifie glorie to come to the Iewes, as this ſhould now vnto vs: yet I will giue you that ſome thing to come is reſpected in both theſe Sacraments, whereby the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver might and may (long after receiving take benefit, and comfort thereby, but this is ſtill communion, which may be renued, confirmed, encreaſed, virtually from the Sacraments, having beene vſed in an heavenly manner) but this will availe your cauſe nothing at all.</p>
                     <p>Next for Baptiſme and Circumciſion, how may it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect </seg>11</label> that they ſignifie any thing to come? <hi>Oh</hi> (ſaith <note n="n" place="margin">Pag. 41.</note> he) <hi>how ſhould not Paptiſme ſignifie our perfect waſhing, which is the ſtate of a glorious Church as well as our new birth?</hi> I anſwere, we neede not be perſuaded by interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, except the ſame included ſome effectuall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to worke vpon our vnderſtanding. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that Baptiſme ſignifies ſomething to come, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly nothing elſe but perfecting of our ſanctification, or perfect ſanctification. And this I may yeeld you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trouble to my ſelfe in the matter controverted: for as Baptiſme, which is the firſt ſacrament, reſembles our perfect ſanctification, whereby we be fitted for perfect communion with Chriſt; ſo the Supper, which is the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:14577:89"/>
ſecond Sacrament may repreſent that our perfect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion being perfectlie ſanctified. Here it you ſee fit and anſwerable ſignifications of ſomething to come in both theſe Evangelicall ſacraments; but all this while here is nothing, which makes for proofe, that any ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſignifie properlie, and be types of glorie, which is but an acceſſorie both to ſanctification, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and yet belike the Replier would inſinuate, that Baptiſme ſignifies glorie, by ſaying, that the perfect clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, (which Baptiſme repreſenteth) is the ſtate of a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Church: as if this predication were tolerable. A gracious ſtate is a glorious ſtate, that is, grace is glorie: for though they goe together, yet they be diverſe things, and that which ſignifies y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> on, doth not therefore proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifie the other. But what now if I graunt that all the ſacramen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And what thing that is pleaſant to vs and good; may not in this manner ſignifie heavenlie glorie?) or immediate, (for how many conſequences muſt you bring this ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about by?) or laſtly inſtituted; for the Lord never ſpake a word, to giue any man to wit of ſuch a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall ſignification.

Certainly if the ſacrament conſider not Chriſts Kingly office, then muſt you ceaſe to talke of coheirſhip at the participation of it: but if Chriſt be conſidered in his Kingly office there, then I pray will not a carriage of inferioritie verie well become you?</p>

yet therefore ſubjection is not to be denied to the ſoveraigne Lord of all.

Then I partly denie, partly diſtinguiſh; I deny that ſuch fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity is lawfull more, which men had with him vpon earth, that is, which one man hath with another. For therein partly it is evident manifeſtation who he is, and partly his glorification makes difference enough. And as for the familiaritie of man and wife, though Chriſt and and his Church be deſcribed as husband and wife in Scripture allegorically, yet it is onely to be applyed in ſpirituall things, and ſtandeth not in corporall geſtures. And beſides ſuch familiarity as is betweene Chriſt and his Church is common in all ordinances, eſpecially in the word of grace, wherein he ſpeaketh to her, and in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er wherein ſhe ſpeaketh vnto him againe. And for prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er let me adde a word more, doth ever Chriſtian ſoule converſe more familiarly with Chriſt, then when ſhee communes with him in praier? She enters into his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to him, ſolaceth her ſelfe in his loue; <note n="q" place="margin">Cantic. 2. 14.</note> her <hi>voice is ſweet</hi> vnto his ear; her <hi>cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance comely</hi> in his eyes: words cannot be vſed to note greater familiarity of the ſoule with Chriſt, that is ſpirituall communion, then ſhe hath with him in praier.

In prayer a Chriſtian ſoule acteth the part of a begger, knocking at the doore of Gods mercy; again he acteth the part of Chriſts ſpouſe, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conferring with her Lord and husband. In the word, a Chriſtian may act the part of a malefactour arraigned, convicted; of a ſervant, of a child, of a friend, yea of a reall craver and begger, houlding out his hand for almes, though he ſay nothing; <note n="t" place="margin">Pſa. 81. 8. 10</note> opening his mouth 28 it were, hungerly, and needily, that God may fill it. In receiving likewiſe he may act the part of a confeſſour, of a remembrancer, of an homager, of a feeder, of one that renders thankes, &amp;c. and in all theſe ordinances, he acts the part of a worſhipper<hi>:</hi> therefore to ſay kneeling is contrary to the perſon of a coheire, is to ſay, kneeling is contrary, and it is not contrary; it is lawfull, and it is not lawfull.

                     <p>Thirdly, if kneeling be contrary to our coheireſhip, then mans duty, and Gods graces be contrary; for let <label type="milestone">

I anſwer, if they doe, then in all ſuch good actions, where theſe conſiderations haue due place, we in theſe reſpects act the part of coheires, though we doe not act it in geſture; and why do you make ſuch an exception at this? As if when you ſpeake of acting the perſon of coheires in the Sacrament, you ſpeake of acting ſuch a part, as is to be acted in no other buſines, or ſervice in his Church, or in private: truly if you had ſpoke onely of acting the part of ſuch as remember Chriſts death by conſecrated ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of bread and wine; then you had ſpoken of ſuch a part as is common to no other ſervice, or buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the world, (and yet that part might be acted in any outward geſture) but when you ſpeake of acting the part of coheires, you ſpeak of a part which may be common to all good ſervice or buſineſſes (ſpiritually conſidered) in the world. But what high ſtreines and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

[Wherfore you ſhould haue called ſociall admittance and enterteinment the prerogatiues of invited gueſts, not of tables in generall.] Secondly, but let it be ſo, that <hi>ſociall admittance and enterteinment are prerogatiues of civill tables,</hi> are they therefore prerogatiues of the Lords table? how doe you proue that? Namely, <note n="c" place="margin">Pag. 27.</note> by a principle in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>that what agrees to the generall as it is ſuch, the ſame agreeth to each speciall comprehended vnder it:</hi> ſo you apply what agrees to a table of repaſt in generall, that is to all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill tables, the ſame agrees to the table of the Lord. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, hereby you bewray your ſelfe; you diſcover ſome ignorance. That which agrees to all civill tables, doth it agree to tables in generall? Surely the generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends both ſacred and civill tables, which are the two kindes or ſpecials of tables in generall. Therefore when you ſay ſo oft, that ſociall admiſſion and enterteinment agree to all tables in generall, (and you ſhow this one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their ordination in civill vſe) you doe forget or not conſider that. Sacred tables are one ſort comprehended vnder the generall. This is weake pleading your cauſe. Againe you tell vs, that the civill table is not changed in the properties of it.

It ſeemes vpon the fifth of <hi>Novemb.</hi> and like extraordinarie dayes, and times of thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, you doe judge ſitting to be the fitteſt geſture to expreſſe faith and thankfulneſſe: but one proofe for ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting would haue done well. Let vs paſſe to ſtanding; how doe you prooue that ſtanding is the fitteſt geſture to expreſſe faith and thankfulneſſe? You deliver <note n="ſ" place="margin">Abridg p. 67.</note> onely one place of Scripture, namely, 1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 8. 54. and to that place, as if it were vnanſwerable, you <note n="t" place="margin">Repl. partic. to B<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>Mort.</hi> p. 43.</note> ſtand vpon it, that you are not anſwered. And I anſwere you thus, that the reaſon of <hi>Solomons</hi> ſtanding was to bleſſe the congregation of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> which bleſſing is divided into thanksgiving, verſe 56. petition, verſ. 57, 58, 59, 60. and exhortation, verſe 61. and hee ſtood vp in this bleſſing, that all the people might heare him, to whom he ſpake (as he had need) with a loud voice, verſe 55. Now I commend to your conſideration: firſt, that ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was not vſed by <hi>Solomon,</hi> becauſe of thankſgiving vnto God, but becauſe of audible ſpeaking to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and bleſſing of them. Secondly, this place will not commend ſtanding in thankſgiving as the fitteſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, but then alſo that it is much more fit in peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (farre fitter then kneeling even in petition) foure to one.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in <hi>Solomons</hi> long prayer which he made vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his knees, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 13. hee vſed more words of thankſgiving, then he did at this time; as 1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 8. 23, 24. and yet I ſay hee kneeled vpon his knees: and more examples I ſhall adde to it by and by. Verily this is poore doing, when all your ſtrength lies wholly on ſuch a place. But what needes all this? I am content to help you to better proofes for the fitneſſe of ſtanding, to expreſſe faith and thankfullneſſe, vpon occaſion, as is likewiſe for the fitneſſe of other geſtures. Such as you may ſee, <hi>(Pag.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 10.) But that ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in its fitnes for expreſſing of faith and thankfulnes ſhould be oppoſed to a geſture of humilitie and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,

                  <p>The ſecond limitation is of bodily worſhip of liberty, for may not one man ſtand in praier, vpon occaſion, <label type="milestone">

not know that in the ſubſtance of worſhip they do well agree with the reſt of the aſſembly, onely they differ in circumſtances of geſture? Which difference frequently occurreth among your ſelues, and theſe exemplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſo plaine that the Diſputer can ſay nothing to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the third limitation is of private worſhip of <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> ſucceſſion, when by reaſon of ſucceſſiue performance of publick worſhip ſeverall members of the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may ſeeme to performe a ſevered worſhip from the reſt, but it is onely ſevered in the point of time and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth not from the maine worſhip celebrated with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick conſent. Thus the Apoſtles received the Sacrament into their hands and mouths, with ſome difference of time: for it is not likelie, that they tooke into their hands and mouths bread all together. But for the cup it it is out of doubt that they received ſucceſſiuely, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they did all drinke of the ſame cup, and had not every one a ſeverall cup by himſelfe at the ſame moment. Indeed this is no private or ſevered worſhip, but that which is truely publick, for what is the publick, but the ſevered worſhip of all the people preſent either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at once, if the nature of the ſervice will admit, or ſucceſſiuely, if it will not?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the forth limitation is of privat worſhip of <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> appropriation; whereby I do not onely meane, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans worſhip may be called his properly, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes it; but alſo that the very publick adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be vſed in reſpect of one ſingular man alone for a certeine ſpace of time, and this I ſhall make to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
                  <p>Now I deſcend to your aſſumption [that kneeling at the Sacrament is a private worſhip during the time and <label type="milestone">

Secondly, when the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate commands ſomething which is indifferent, it is not the part, or honour of a Chriſtian to refuſe to do it, becauſe in himſelfe he had libertie to do otherwiſe: but rather it is an excellent priviledge which he hath, that having libertie of many things, he can make vſe thereof even in that one, to pleaſe, and ſatisfie him (vnto whoſe

for doubtleſſe, the Apoſtles words may be applyed generally, to ſuch Ceremonyes, as againſt which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes them himſelfe particularly, that is ſuch, whereby the conſciences of men in the Doctrine, and opinion thereof are ſubiected, and bondaged.

I anſwer, our teaching can inferre no ſuch matter<hi>:</hi> for, firſt, the Papiſts haue a companie of ceremonies, which you will denie can be indifferent in their vſe in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.

                     <p>Secondly, beſides the Papiſts put in the opinion and doctrine of them a bondage vpon mens conſciences, and take away the reſpect of their indifferencie. Now this is a ſure ground of truth, that whatſoever action or thing indifferent may be vſed in Gods worſhip lawfully, and no opinion be put vpon the conſcience, which takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the full reſpect of its indifferencie, the ſame may be enjoyned, our Chriſtian libertie notwithſtanding: but from ſuch a one to inferre to the Popiſh ceremonies, is as

                     <p>The Major is falſe: for ſuppoſe a man, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe allowing well of our aſſemblies, ſhould refuſe to joyne with them, becauſe he will not worſhip God in our temples, would not ſuſpenſion, (if he were a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter) and excommunication faſten vpon him in this Church, trow you? you cannot make a queſtion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of<hi>:</hi> but ſhould therefore the Church be charged for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning ſuch or ſuch particular temples as neceſſarie to ſalvation? By no meanes; for the Church eſteemeth place a circumſtance which may be changed, as neede and edification require. You will requeſt peradventure, that theſe puniſhments be exceſſiue: I anſwer, exceſſe of puniſhment doth not inferre opinion of ſpirituall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie. It is a plaine <hi>non ſequitur. Refuſall to kneele is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with exceſſe: therefore kneeling is enioyned for neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to ſalvation.</hi> For all the world knoweth, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences about indifferent things may be puniſhed with exceſſe, though the opinion of their indifferencie doe remaine<hi>:</hi> yea for Eccleſiaſticall cenſures it is certaine, that they haue beene wont from time to time to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for breaking of Eccleſiaſticall orders, although the Church impoſing hath judged the ſame to be ſuch as might be varied vpon occaſion.

ſervant now lawfully, and ſafely performe his Maſters commandement, becauſe he backed it with a commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of greater ſeveritie, then he needed to haue done, for any thing he ſeeth or knoweth? ſo if the Church be more ſevere in preſſing her orders, and puniſhing the breach of them, then you can allow, that is nothing to the purpoſe, if the ſaid orders may be obeyed. <hi>Saul</hi> 
                        <note n="q" place="margin">1 Sam. 14. 24</note> forbade the people to eate meate vpon paine of vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable extremitie; could the exceſſe of puniſhment threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned make abſtinence vnlawfull to them, or put vpon it opinion of neceſſitie to ſalvation? This no body will affirme, except ſuch as be led by a ſpirit of nothing but contradiction. I but, that which is commanded and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed more then obedience to Gods lawes is held more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie then it, and ſo held neceſſarie to ſalvation. This is true, if the neceſſitie of both looked the ſame way: if kneeling at Sacrament were preſſed and vrged by law, becauſe it is neceſſarie to ſalvation, and greater matters truely ſo neceſſarie not ſo vrged, then I confeſſe this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception might ſeeme to be juſt enough: but the reaſon why kneeling is vrged in this Church, is knowne to be reſpect of Eccleſiaſticall policy, and not as if it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to ſalvation: and for greater matters I make no doubt to ſay, that you doe wrong to this Church and ſtate in accuſing the lawes which (and that ſtrictly) doe ſerue for the puniſhment of groſſe and capitall miſchiefs: but now if all this while you haue ſpoken onely <hi>de fact<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For what I pray can acquit her better, then this, that (as you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme) ſhe alloweth of all geſtures. Theſe things I but mention to note your owne repugnancies, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions to your ſelues, that whiles one while you ſay, the Church and lawes thereof makes kneeling ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie as infringeth Chriſtian libertie, that is by neceſſitie of opinion; another while you deni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is not materiall, what you eſteeme of the geſture in the force of either arguments, but in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect it is to be taken for the right managing of this, that the matter may be brought to an iſſue. Well then, firſt I aske you, if you vrge your argument of Chriſtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as ſuppoſing the geſture to be abominable? And this one while you profeſſedly doe, as the <note n="y" place="margin">Repl. gener. to Bp. <hi>Mort.</hi> ch. 6, anſ. to ſect. 3.</note> Replier ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: <hi>The received ſtate of this queſtion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie from ceremonies, which are appointed vnlawfully.</hi> (In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the Replier prooues this out of the Abridgement by a ſilly reaſon, becauſe the ſaid Abridgement doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where denie the ceremonies to be in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture indifferent: a reaſon without a ſparke of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for it is not materiall in this queſtion at all, that the Abridgement denies kneeling to be indifferent in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arguments: but vpon what <hi>hypotheſis</hi> it preſſeth this argument of libertie: but let this paſſe, let the Replier haue the ſtate of the queſtion to be of libertie from kneeling, as it is ſuppoſed for a geſture which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded vnlawfully) but let me entreate him to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether ever man vſed an argument more vainely and childiſhly, then he vſeth this of Chriſtian liberty from a wicked action: You might as well vſe it to prooue, that it is not lawfull to ſweare, lye, ſteale, and commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie: for who of vs was ever ſo void of vnderſtanding,

That which is vnlawfull, (before Chriſtian libertie be conſidered) is out of doubt to be rejected without delay; but the queſtion ought to be, whether kneeling at Sacrament, though it be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, (as that muſt be preſumed, at leaſt whiles we be parling vpon our Chriſtian libertie) ſhould not be refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for defence of our libertie, againſt the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Magiſtrate?

If you doe not, you cannot denie, but you are contrary to all the Doctours, and learned men that ever the Church had ſince the Apoſtles: If you doe, alas muſt a Canon of a lawfull thing be onely deſpiſed in that Church, to which you owe greater ſewice, then to any of them all? But what will you ſay to all the reformed Churches at this day, which haue conſtitutions of Eccleſiaſticall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, within themſelues, whereunto their owne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be bound, <hi>Geneva</hi> it ſelfe not excepted? is your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie greater then the libertie of all other Chriſtians in the world, or doe you better vnderſtand the matter, and tenour of it then they?

                     <p>Fourthly, I would you did ſeriouſly take knowledge, and call to minde the vnſpeakable comfort, which God <label type="milestone">

Sure this is too rigorous, and harſh behaviour, not without the guilt of hatefull ingratitude. Thirdly, you looke your children and ſervants ſhould obey your ſelues in things indifferent, not onely concerning civill things,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:14577:133"/>
but concerning the ordering of Gods worſhip within your owne doores; for the times, places, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumſtances thereunto belonging: Is not the King <hi>Pater Patriae, et nutricius Eccle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Fifthly, what good reaſon are you able to giue, why the <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>43</label> Magiſtrate, and Churches order for kneeling in prayer, ſtanding in confeſſion of faith, ſtanding, or ſitting in the word, (which you allow, and you ſay the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion booke alſo <note n="o" place="margin">Diſp. p. 2,</note> alloweth:) why their direction for the times and places of divine worſhip, and appointment by you allowed of ſundry matters more, (which being neceſſarie in their kinde are variable in particular deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination) ſhould not depriue vs of Chriſtian liberty, as well as the direction of kneeling at the Lords Supper?

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ooth) it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged, and abuſed in this one onely geſture! If you muſt needes keepe your old wont, and tell vs that knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at Sacrament is vnlawfull in other reſpects, I haue to intreate you to conſider of mine anſwer to thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects in ſuch arguments, where you will point vs vnto them.

I preſſe you therefore to keepe cloſe to the preſent point, and in good ſooth aske your conſciences, if Chriſtian libertie block not vp the way againſt the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:14577:134"/>
Magiſtrate, and Churches ordering in ſome geſtures, and circumſtances of divine worſhip; why it, (I ſay againe Chriſtian libertie) ſhould block vp the way againſt this geſture, and circumſtance in the Lords Supper? Why ſhould you not either giue the Magiſtrate and Church power in all things of indifferent nature, and vſe, or elſe in all theſe vtterly take it away?</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, One thing further I will vrge againſt you, which will trouble you in this Argument of your liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>44</label> if I be not deceived! It is this. It is vndoubted, that if your ſelues had authority to appoynt Eccleſiaſticall Orders in this Church, or they which haue, would bee ruled by you, among other things, you would be ſure to forbid kneeling at Sacrament, and ſuffer Communicants only to ſit or ſtand. Iudge in your ſelues whether we ſhould haue as much reaſon to cry out againſt you for infringing our liberty, as now you haue againſt this Church, for we are perſuaded vpon ſure ground of Gods word, that it were lawfull for vs to kneele in the act of receiving, if kneeling were left at every mans liberty, as you are perſwaded it is lawfull to ſit or ſtand, if ſitting &amp; ſtanding were left at every mans liberty. Therefore if your owne practiſe in forbiding the geſture of kneeling would not hinder our liberty, neither doth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent practiſe of this Church, in forbiding (for Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity ſake for a time) to vſe the geſtures of ſitting, or ſtanding, hinder your liberty: It is the rule of nature, of the Law, and Prophets, and of Chriſt himſelfe <note n="f" place="margin">Luke 6. 31.</note>

Truely, if you kneeled for the moſt part, and vpon occaſion varyed your geſture but ſometime, I am aſſured you would find ſome indulgence in ſo doing. But never to kneele, not one time, and yet make a noyſe about your Chriſtian liberty, is very ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne learning, as if Chriſt had given vs this liberty in indifferent things to be a skonſe againſt the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of authority.

Of the former ſort I haue obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved theſe three. Firſt that kneeling is enjoyned in this Church as neceſſary to ſalvation, that it is preſſed more then Gods Lawes, &amp;c. (for ſo this may be ſaid here

Secondly, kneeling is made in this Church a ſignificant geſture, and therefore you ſay it is impious. Thirdly, kneeling is appoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THis then is one of your exceptions againſt kneeling <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> at Sacrament, that it is appointed by the Church to be a ſignificant geſture, namely to ſignifie humilitie, and gratefull acknowledgement of Gods loue in Chriſt: and ſurely in this exception I finde a minde rather to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace the geſture, then to diſprooue it. The Church doth not teach, that any thing is ſignified thereby, but which would be ſignified, if ſhe had altogether held her peace: ſhe appoints no ſignification, but that which is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <note n="q" place="margin">Treat. of div. worſh. pag. 10.

And was there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpeciall geſture in Gods worſhip, which was not ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant? was not the Publicanes ſmiting vpon the breaſt an evident ſigne of an afflicted and dejected ſpirit? But what ſhould I ſpeake of one ſingular geſture? is not all outward worſhipping a ſigne of inward devotion? or
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:14577:135"/>
elſe all outward worſhipping is Phariſaicall; neither can we at any time judge men to be truely ſerving the Lord, except that outward expreſſions be tokens and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of inward worſhip.</p>

make ſignificant many wayes, as I ſhall particularly ſhew by and by; and is the ſignification of theſe then forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the ſecond commandement? Alas, it cannot be, that the ſecond commandement ſhould forbid the ſignification of geſtures; that it ſhould forbid the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of kneeling in all Sacraments, or in any part of Gods worſhip, whereunto it may lawfullie be applied. And in theſe circumſtances and geſtures whereof I haue given inſtance, you muſt note, that the ſignification was and is inſtituted and of choice as much as in the geſture of the Lords Supper, yea and the things themſelues are as humane ceremonies as the geſture of kneeling in the Sacrament, and as much appointed to Gods ſervice. But if you be put to your anſwer, I imagine you meane that ſignificant kneeling is forbidden, becauſe kneeling it ſelfe is not appointed of God, and then you reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly; for in that reſpect kneeling it ſelfe ſhould bee forbidden, but not (if kneeling otherwiſe were lawfull) the ſignification which is made of it.

                        <hi>Becauſe the vſe which it hath in the Sacrament is derived from the well of man.</hi> I anſwer, if this be a good reaſon, then knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in prayer is an humane ordinance, becauſe it is in the choyce of mans will to vſe it or no, ſo ſtanding at prayer is an humane ordinance for the ſame reaſon; for man is not abſolutely bound to ſtand or to kneele, but hath libertie of choice, as there is occaſion: you ſhould conſider, that geſture by Gods ordinance, is neceſſarie in its kinde, (in which reſpect it is divine) and is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of mans will onely for particular accommodation thereof; ſo the variation is mans, (and yet but after a ſort neither, becauſe it is according to the rule of the word) but the geſture it ſelfe let it be which you will in it ſelfe is Gods owne bleſſed ordinance. But you deliver your mindes further in the negatiue, ſaying, <hi>that is an humane ordinance, that is neither derived from nature, nor from the civill cuſtome of our Nation.</hi> I anſwer, that knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in Gods worſhip is derived from nature, who can haue the face to denie<hi>:</hi> and for a civill cuſtome it is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to ſay, that derivation from an humane cuſtome, makes a divine ordinance, that kneeling is not a divine ordinance, becauſe it is not derived from a civill and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane cuſtome: and yet in truth kneeling is according to the civill cuſtome of our Countrey, as in your next point is to be tryed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, you muſt make good, that kneeling is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated <label type="milestone">

I will ſay as much of the word, whereat it is lawfull to kneele, as well as at the Lords Supper; if we compare the ordinances themſelues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without reſpect of ſcandalls, and cuſtomes of times. Further if we take occaſion to kneele at one ordinance, and not equally at another, that inferre not, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we kneele at that one vnlawfully. Many things may procure, and effect a difference among the people of God, though there be no commandment. I aske you, why you kneele in prayer; Doth the reſpect of Gods preſence, and the nature of the Ordinance moue you If it doe, why doth not the ſame preſence, and ordinance moue you as well in table-bleſſing? Why doe we ever ſit bare at the Sacrament, and not ever at the word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?

If the Sacrament mooue vs to be vncovered, why doth not the word Preached mooue as well?

praepoſitions <hi>[by</hi> and <hi>in</hi> the Sacrament] are not ſimply to be excluded, as appeareth in Sect. 24. And if they be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in any ſenſe, then in that which <hi>Durandus</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth, when he ſaith, <hi>In the preſence of the Image or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi> By no meanes, Sir, the Biſhop alloweth thoſe words, <hi>We may kneele in preſence of the Sacrament,</hi> but not in <hi>Durandus</hi> his ſenſe, who teacheth, if you conſider his meaning, that Chriſt is to be worſhipped in the face or preſence of an image, ſo as that preſence anſwereth for the reall preſence of Chriſt himſelfe.

                     <p>Secondly, but ſuppoſe it be true, that ancient Papiſts <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>15</label> gaue no worſhip divine to their images at all, that they ſaid no more, then we doe of kneeling at the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, (if their images were but Gods ordinances, as the Sacrament is) we maintaine, that they ſaid well. You thinke ſtill to daſh vs out of countenance with the name of the Papiſts. We confeſſe we be aſhamed of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie in that which is properly called Poperie, but we ſhould never be aſhamed of the truth, though the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts profeſſe it. Now it is no Poperie to take occaſion from Gods creatures to worſhip him, eſpecially from ſuch as are the matter of publick worſhip by himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted: how idle is it then for pleaſing of your owne ſide, to be often ſaying, <hi>the Papiſts will ſay as much.</hi> Is not the Sacrament to be vſed for remembrance of Chriſts ſufferings, becauſe the Popiſh Crucifixe is vſed for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of them?</p>

You (I doubt wilfully) doe miſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret his words; for when he ſaith, that the relation is made from the ſigne, he meanes nothing leſſe, then that adoration is made vpon, or to the ſigne, but the kneeler adores the Lord in reference vnto the ſigne, as an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or motiue of his adoring: and this himſelfe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth ſo plainely, as words can be vſed, if yet words can ſuffice to ſatisfie you. Sect. 28. he ſayes, <hi>A man in kneeling at Sacrament, vpon ſight thereof, ſhould abſtract his thoughts from the ſenſible obiect, and lift vp his eyes and heart to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, adoring God and Chriſt.</hi> Again, Sect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 31. <hi>We vſe kneeling,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>tanquam obiectum à quo, that vpon ſight of this Sacrament, as a viſible word, (even as at the hearing of the audible words of Gods booke) our hearts may be mooved to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore God.</hi> But what neede I name any other place, then Sect. 35.

AS by the weakeneſſe of your exceptions I am more <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>17</label> confirmed in the lawfulneſſe of kneeling before the Sacramentall elements, ſo long as we worſhip God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and not them either abſolutely, or relatiuely: So (beſides alſo what I haue ſaid of the lawfulneſſe of kneeling by occaſion of creatures, in generall, before <note n="y" place="margin">Sect. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</note> in anſwer to your propoſition) I am yet ſtill more confirmed therein, by the conſideration of theſe things following.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, if kneeling <hi>(ipſo facto)</hi> is and cannot but be vſed to the bread and wine, then the Sacrament would be an idoll to vs, and to ſo many, as ever did receiue it in the <note place="margin">Will they not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

But I doubt not, it hath beene, and is better, both with our forefathers, and alſo with vs, elſe not onely the caſe were lamentable for vs, but it would follow our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Sacrament is no Sacrament of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is very worthy to be obſerved, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>18</label> your imputation of idolatry is againſt our kneeling in the very act of eating, we cannot ſo much as worſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bread at that time. Nay, how abſurd, and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous is it to put vpon vs the worſhipping of the bread, when we be breaking, and tearing it with our teeth? If the queſtion were of kneeling in the act of holding vp the bread before vs, your imputation were much more likely to faſten vpon vs; but when the queſtion is of the act of eating, your charge of idolatry hath not ſo much as probabilitie of truth. And it is a cleere caſe, that the controverſie betwixt vs, is about the geſture, which is to be vſed in the act of receiving, and not in the act of behoulding the bread, and wine. Perhaps, if you had conſidered of this matter, you would not haue put con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in this argument.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="282" facs="tcp:14577:149"/>
Thirdly, if you ſay that kneeling before the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>19</label> creatures, before they be received or eaten, is the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry which you meane, then it is not lawfull for a man to kneele downe, (though he be alone) to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, before the creatures of a civill table, for <note n="z" place="margin">See Bp. <hi>Mort.</hi> ſect 42. in the chapt. of knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. See alſo the Repl. idle anſwer.</note> vnto that practiſe your exception will equally be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, if it be idolatry to kneele before the bread <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>20</label> and wine, becauſe there is a religious reſpect vnto them, then is the like idolatry committed in kneeling before the Miniſter, who is concurrent in occaſioning the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall worſhip, as he is a neceſſarie man in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall imployment. Indeed, he is no occaſion ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther immediate or direct, yet ſo farre as he is an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, idolatry ſhall as well be committed with him, that is, remotely, and indirectly. And like as peradventure you would not allow kneeling before the Preacher, (of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and choyce) of whom we receiue the word, leſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vſed before a creature with religious reſpect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, you ſhould adore him in ſtead of Chriſt: ſo for that reſpect muſt kneeling be alike idolatrous, which is vſed before the Miniſter of whom we doe receiue the Sacrament. I thinke you can put no difference. So by this Logick it followeth, that the beſt Miniſter, as well as the bread and wine, is a very idoll to the congregation of kneeling Communicants.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, will not you allow the heart in the Sacrament <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>21</label> while, to looke vpon God immediately? will not you expreſſely ſerue and worſhip him in your heart, (who is the object of all religion) any part of that time? will you allow no ejaculation of prayer? no bowing the heart in thankfull acknowledgement? Verily, if you will not, worthy you are, whoſe (I will ſay) impietie all men ſhould trample vnder foote. And yet I deeme no ſuch thing of any of you. I perſuade my ſelfe you doe, in your owne practiſe allow of theſe things. Well, yet looke what idolatry is committed by the body in worſhipping,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:14577:149"/>
(as you ſay kneeling of the body is idolatrous, let the conceipt of the ſoule be what it will) the ſame ſhall be much more committed by the ſoule in worſhipping, (let the carriage of the bodie be ſitting, or ſtanding) eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when the bodie can be ſaid to worſhip no more, then the ſtones of the pauement, or the picture of a man kneeling, but becauſe it is <hi>acted</hi> by the ſoule, which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth, and willeth, and ſo is capable of the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of worſhipping.</p>

But let me poſe you, that ſay vncovering of the head in religious vſe is not worſhipping, but reverencing: do you vſe it in reverence of God, or of the creatures? If you ſay, you vſe it to God, me thinkes there ſhould be no great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, of its worſhipping. For doe not we put off our hate to men in civill worſhipping? Is it not a kind of worſhip, as well as bowing of the knee vnto them? Is not alſo a worſhipping in the act of prayer? Is it not worſhipping in Papiſts, when they vſe to vncover their heads to their images? I ſee not, what you can anſwer. But if you ſay, you vncover your heads to the creatures of bread and wine; then I pray, how doth not the ſecond commandement forbid you ſo to doe before a creature, and with religious reſpect vnto it without Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement? How can you ſaue that carriage from the ſtayne of idolatry, according to the propoſition of your owne ſyllogiſme?

So it being

moſt certaine, that vncovering of the head is vſed in the Sacrament with immediate reſpect to God, and ſo is a faſhion of worſhipping, if it be no idolatrous worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, then kneeling is not idolatrous. Surely, if that be lawfull in Gods ſervice before the creatures of bread and wine, and with religious reſpect vnto them, (that is, as the occaſion of it) in that reſpect wherein it is lawfull, kneeling cannot be condemned.

That which they might haue done, (and ſo we haue imitated them therein) we may as lawfully doe, though they actually did it not, becauſe, that which made it lawfull to them, and imitable of vs, implies reaſon of common intereſt.

Beſides, this exception affirming onely danger of Idolatry in kneeling at Sacrament, doth not ſimply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne it in it ſelfe. And for danger of Idolatry, it falls to be handled in another place: ſo the illuſtration ſtill holds to the purpoſe, whereunto it is vſed<hi>:</hi> namely, <hi>that as in receiuing gifts of Princes, ſo it is not Idolatry in it ſelfe to kneele vnto God, before and by occaſion of his gifts,</hi> povid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the gifts be conſidered, but as an occaſion.</p>
                     <p>But one ſpeech of the <hi>Abridgement</hi> ſeemes to be very <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>38</label> weake, which it vſeth to ſet out this exception. It is this. <hi>It hath ben found in all ages the chiefe roote of Idolatry, if it be not groſſe Idolatry it ſelfe, to giue vnto the gift the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reverence, and adoration that is due to the giver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi> Is this ſpeech ment of Princes gifts, or of Gods? If you vnderſtand it of Princes gifts, then you thinke it is Idolatry it ſelfe, perhaps to kneele vnto them when we receiue their gifts, howſoever, that ſuch kneeling is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vnlawfull, as being a chiefe roote of Idolatry. And ſo the proportion will hold betwixt that kneeling to them, and kneeling to God, (as your ſelues eſteeme of
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:14577:155"/>
it) in the Sacrament, wherein yet you would declare difference. And yet ſtill ſuch an aſſertion is falſe. But if you vnderſtand it of Gods gifts, you make an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent hypotheſis, as if our kneeling at Sacrament, were given to the elements of bread and wine, and not vnto God alone, and onely occaſioned by them. Therefore in this ſence, your ſpeech is altogether impertinent.</p>

And laſtly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it mattereth not in the force and vſe of our illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, whether we receiue the gift mediately, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, ſo long as the ſaid gift is (howſoever) but an occaſion of worſhipping. If the reſpect of mediatenes, of receiving the gifts, did inferre the kneeling of him, which receiues the ſame to be directed vnto it, then this exception were to ſome purpoſe. But we apply the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration in this manner. Its lawfull to kneele to God vpon occaſion of a gift, which we receiue from him, as it is lawfull to kneele to a Prince or parent, vpon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of gifts receiued from them. It skilleth not, whether the receiuing be like in both for the point of immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, conſidering it doth not alter the caſe, for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the gifts of either to be more then occaſions of kneeling.</p>

Kneeling is a naturall geſture, and a geſture of humble reverence. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence is due to the King at all times, ſpecially when he conferreth ſome ſingular gift, or honour vpon his ſervants. Reverence and the moſt humble expreſſions of reverence are much more due to God, then to earthly Potentates. Spirituall, and thoſe the moſt excellent gifts are a better, and greater occaſion, to mooue vs to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the donour, then temporall, and tranſitory gifts can be.

                     <p>Here I might anſwer two queſtions which offer <label type="milestone">

Concerning the three former reſpects it may be asked, what kind of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip this kneeling is, which is occaſioned by them, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether it be bare, and meere adoration without prayer, or elſe worſhipping, ſuch as is in the exerciſe of prayer? <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is no doubt, but as prayer is made in our Church in the deliverie of the bread and wine, ſo it may be ſecretly made alſo (as the ſtate of the Communicants ſoule requireth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is true, as <note n="e" place="margin">Manuſcrip. ch. 7.</note> you ſay: <hi>Firſt, it is not neceſſarie alwayes to kneele when we doe pray, as in table-bleſſing we doe not. Secondly, it is dangerous and vnlawfull to kneele in prayer, before an Idoll, before the Breaden God, and in Market places, where we ſhould be guilty of ſhew of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, and of ſcandall. Thirdly, it is not neceſſarie we ſhould pray or giue thankes in the act of receiving.</hi> But what is all this to the purpoſe? <hi>Many things are lawfull, which at all times are not expedient,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 12.

Therefore, where the Author of the <hi>Manuſcript</hi> preſently addeth, <hi>that it is not ſit to pray in the act of receiving,</hi> he ſpeaketh that which is not fit: for prayer doth helpe, (and not hinder, if it be rightly vſed) faith to receiue aright, that which God in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, doth offer, and exhibite vnto vs.</p>
                     <p>But for my part, if there be no prayer vſed in the time <label type="milestone">

                     <p>Firſt, the diſtinction of worſhip, and veneration is <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>46</label> ſuch, as cannot be refuſed. Now both theſe are to be
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:14577:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>
found both in civility, and religion. In religion you confeſſe the ſame, namely, that worſhip is one thing, and veneration another. In civility the ſame is no leſſe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: for as in religion worſhip <note n="k" place="margin">
                           <hi>Perth. Aſſ.</hi> 47.</note> belongeth to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and veneration to the things of perſons, ſo in like manner is it in civill matters, that carriage of reſpect, which is expreſſely directed vnto the perſon of any man is properly civill worſhip, whereas civill things pertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to perſons are by no meanes capable of civill wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but onely of that which we call adoration or reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Thus farre I hope we ſhall be ſoone agreed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, veneration, or reverence ſtandeth in two <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>47</label> things<hi>:</hi> firſt, in the inward conceit, and eſtimation of the minde. Secondly, in the outward vſage according to the nature of the thing, which is to be reverenced: thus your ſelues doe determine. <hi>I haue ſundry times,</hi> (ſaies the <note n="l" place="margin">Repl. partic. to Bp. <hi>Mort.</hi> p. 69.</note> Replier) <hi>affirmed, that we ſtand as much and more for true reverence, both inward, and outward, in celebration of the Sacrament, then our adverſaries doe.</hi> Now outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, is nothing elſe, but the vſing of things decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and honourably, according to their kinde, that is, when they are not vſed lightly, contemptuouſly, vnci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy, &amp;c. but as the matter, place, and imployment, whereunto the ſaid things deſerue, ſhall evidently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire<hi>:</hi> and herein alſo you doe fully agree with vs.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, outward reverence riſeth to things two <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>48</label> wayes: firſt, by immediate expreſſions primarily inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and meerely vſed to declare reverence, as in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things, pulpit-cloth, table-cloth, beautie of bookes and ſeates, &amp;c. and ſuch other-like things, that are vſed for ornament: alſo waſhen hands for handling of the water, and bread in the Sacraments, and other like pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, tending onely to ſhew due account of Gods holy ordinances. And in civill things a man both may and ought to vſe that which is his neighbours or friends, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is for the kind and quality of it) reſpectiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Secondly, outward reverence commeth to things by
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:14577:158"/>
ſuch expreſſions as are directed to the perſon of another, whence ariſeth ſome reverence, to that which is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of them. I will giue inſtance in civill things. When a gift is received from a ſuperiour, ſpeciall civill worſhip is done vnto the donor, and yet it is plaine, that ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect even from thence ariſeth to the gift received. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if a Prince make an oration, the ſubjects declare worſhip to the perſon of the Prince, yet ſome reſpect and reverence is inferred thereby vnto the ſpeech it ſelfe; but in Eccleſiaſticall duties, and ordinances, there is nothing more cleere: for what worſhip of God can you name, but ſome reverence ariſeth to the matter, and motiue thereof? Can you pray in a beſeeming geſture, heare in a beſeeming geſture, be baptized in a beſeeming geſture, ſing Pſalmes in a beſeeming geſture, &amp;c. but thence, (though God be the object of all divine worſhipping, and ſo of all theſe exerciſes, as farre as you call them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping) yet I ſay thence will ariſe ſome comelineſſe, and ornament, eſteeme, and dignitie vnto the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces themſelues.</p>
                     <p>This will be yet more manifeſt, if you conſider that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>49</label> in Gods worſhip, <note n="m" place="margin">See back part 1. ch. 4. ſect. 6. &amp;c.</note> muſt needs haue a double conſideration. Firſt, as they be worſhipping. 2ly, as they be geſtures of decency and comelines. Kneeling in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer is a geſture of worſhipping directed to God alone, yet kneeling in prayer, is part of the Apoſtles decency, as <hi>Mr. Calvin</hi> teacheth. I beſeech you now, is kneeling in prayer vſed or directed to the ſenſible matter of prayer? That cannot be; yet it brings reverence, that is, come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and ornament, eſteeme and dignity thereunto, which cannot be denyed. How then riſeth this reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence? Verily the reverence is conſequent, and iſſues out of the geſture, for though it be directed only to God in heauen, yet all men ſee it is a comely ornament, and commendable reſpect of the prayer it ſelfe. Where is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry in all this brethren? We ſay no more of receiving the Sacramentall elements; our kneeling is directd to
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:14577:159"/>
God alone. That reverence, that cometh to the elements riſeth onely out of this, that wee come to God ſo reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, when we doe receiue them. We hold firmely, that no adoring geſtures are to be vſed for directing of reverence vnto the creatures, and ſo if kneeling were not directed to the Lord, it ought not then to be vſed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of the Sacrament, if it were, it could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed from being idolatrous.</p>
                     <p>But your ſelues are fowler ouerſeene in the matter of <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>50</label> reuerence, then wee, and then (I ſuppoſe) you be well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of. You <note n="n" place="margin">Repl. partic. to Bp. <hi>Mort.</hi> p. 70.</note> teach, <hi>that you vncouer your heads not for adoration, but onely for reverence in receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> For reuerence, and not adoration? whom, or what meane you to reverence I beſeech you? God you cannot ſay, for then you could not exclude the reſpect of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping or adoring therein. It ſeemes then you doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence the Elements of bread and wine, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe geſture of worſhip vſed unto them. Behold this is more then I durſt ſay of the geſture of kneeling. But let me aske you. In ciuill vſe, you know wee put off our hats to perſons, as inferiours to their ſuperiours, not vnto bread and wine at our civill tables. This vncovering then in the Sacrament (in your ſenſe) is to take a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per geſture of worſhip, (belonging to perſons) and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to things in way of veneration onely, which the <hi>Scotchmen</hi> haue condemned before. You will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to worſhip God, by being vncovered, and ſo let a certaine grace, and ornament iſſue to the ordinance which is in hand, but you will be vncovered out of meere reverence of ſenſible things. For my part I ſay as much of vncovering as I doe of kneeling, that they be both faſhions of worſhip directed onely to God, yet conſequently doe yeeld a certaine reverence to thoſe things, that be the matter and motiue of them, while by them we come to God ſo reverently in his ordinance: and the lawfulneſſe of this reverence, you can never be able to take away, except you could take away all geſtures
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:14577:159"/>
of worſhipping, that is, all outward worſhipping vtterly out of the Church; for even from thoſe very geſtures, a great part of the reverence of holy things, that is, the decencie, and ornament, dignity and eſteeme of the ſaid holy things, evermore ariſeth. Here you muſt be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to judge vprightly betwixt you and your ſelues, namely, your affections, and conſciences.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, furthermore outward reverence of holy <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>51</label> things riſing and iſſuing from the ſoveraigne worſhip of God, admitteth degrees. When the Sacrament is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſitting, or ſtanding, we doe not ſurmiſe, that it muſt neede: be received therefore vnreverently, yet ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures doe procure more reverence vnto it, then ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And I doubt not to ſay, there be certaine points wherein this may be conſidered of the geſture of knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. For, 1. it is a carriage importing the greateſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of of the ſacred myſteries. 2ly, it is a carriage of plain religion, and devotion, no geſture in it ſelfe ſeemeth more to ſhew pietie. 3ly, it is a carriage of plaine humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and ſeemes as it were to vtter for the Communicant, the voice of the <hi>Centurion: Lord, I am not worthy, thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt come vnder my roofe;</hi> or Lord, I am not worthy to come vnder thy roofe, much leſſe to fit at thy table. Fourthly, it is a carriage of ſpeciall reſpect for the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing of Sacramentall eating from common. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of which difference moved them in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church to take away common ſuppers from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Communion of Chriſts body and blood, and the ſpeech of the Apoſtle <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. verſ. 29, 22.</note> ſeemes thereunto to incline, whereby he taxeth them, for not judgeing of the Lords body, asking them, if they had not houſes to eate and drinke in. Theſe points haue their vſe to ſhew, that as kneeling is applied to the ſoveraigne worſhip of God, much reverence ariſeth to the Sacrament from it, at leaſt to ſhew, (I wot) that ſome degree of reverence ariſeth vndoubtedly.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, this reverend vſage of the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament <label type="milestone">

crament is profitable for all or the moſt part of men in ſome meaſure. Firſt for opinion, and that both in godly and carnall Communicants; thoſe it ſtirres vp to either conſider or encreaſe the due and needfull eſtimation of the holy Sacrament<hi>:</hi> theſe it helpeth to ſuppreſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane conceits, whereby their irreligious hearts are eaſily perſuaded to deſpiſe the ordinance of Chriſt. Next for practiſe both for preparation, &amp; vſe, inward, &amp; outward, to good &amp; bad; the mind will be ſtirred vp to thoughts of our vnſpeakable vnworthineſſe, and of Chriſts loue, the heart will be mooved both to mount vp to God in all ſweete adherence and dependance, and ſecretly alſo to bleſſe the bleſſed authour of its everlaſting welfare<hi>:</hi> in a word for the outward carriage, it will be as a monitour, giving every man a ſilent <hi>Cave,</hi> to beware of looſeneſſe, and ſawcineſſe. And eſpecially all this in theſe laſt, and worſe times, wherein men are ſo very carnall, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the judging, and handling of Gods holy things. Now your objections againſt the foreſaid doctrine will be of ſmall value, as may be tried.</p>

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:14577:161"/>
ſecond we doe diſclaime. The laſt cannot be condemned by their example, partly, becauſe examples of geſtures be various, both vſed and left at liberty in all ordinances, ſee part. 1 chap. 1. partly becauſe Chriſt and his Apoſtles geſture is not certainly known vnto vs; the Apoſtles, and Saints ſhewed as much reverence in receiving as we for ought any body can infallibly tell to the contrary: and partly, becauſe though they vſed onely the geſture of ſitting, (yet thence as from your owne ſitting, and ſtanding, being duely applied) ſome reverence could not but reflect vpon the Sacramentall elements. It can be none other in all geſtures of divine worſhip rightly v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, albeit ſome procure more reverence by the kinde, and manner of them, then others.

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:14577:161"/>
I aſſure you, and never to be graunted as I belieue. For the particular inſtance it maketh againſt your ſelues: for whereas touching geſtures there is <hi>altum ſilentium</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. yet there is direction for taking away civill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions, (though lawfull in themſelues) when they are abuſed in the Lords Supper. For it appeareth, that the profaneſſe of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> was in regard of the loue-feaſts altogether, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 22, 23. which therefore the Apoſtle remooved vtterly from the Sacrament. But you can inferre nothing at all from ſuch order as he tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that prophaneſſe to a neceſſitie, that he muſt needs haue ordered for kneeling, if it be a lawfull ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of reverence<hi>:</hi> becauſe there was enough ordered for their particular caſe, in vtter aboliſhing of their loue-feaſts, the abuſes whereof fell out before the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per began, and the reverence of the Sacrament may be maintained in other geſtures, though that which ariſeth from kneeling, (when it may be vſed) nay be very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable in due time.

Thoſe thoughts which he committed to writing you may be acquainted withall, but he committed to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no thoughts it all of the neceſſitie of this or that geſture in the Sacrament, nay, gaue no particular order to the Churches, about geſtures in any ordinance of God in any one of all his writings, that I remember.

This objection makes a miſerable <hi>non-ſequitur,</hi> howſoever it be expounded. If you meane by [thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced] as much as [worſhipped with divine worſhip] it is vtterly inconſequent; for if Chriſt did make choice of creatures to be ſo reverenced, (which he never did not will doe) yet it followes not, that he would not make choice of the meaneſt, aſſoone as of the greateſt, whereby his worſhip ſhould be conveyed vnto him: nay, it is likely in reaſon, if the Sunne, and Moone, and hoſt of heaven, and the moſt excellent things in nature ſhould haue bin choſen for objects of relatiue worſhip, the blind world would ſometimes deify them, (as it hath done heretofore) and wholly intend, and terminate worſhip vnto them; whereas in baſer creatures the worſhip would be more probably conveyed vnto God himſelfe. But howſoever in this ſenſe your objection is nothing <hi>ad rem,</hi> for we confeſſe that worſhipping of the outward elements is damnable idolatry. If you meane by reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence no other thing then I haue before allowed, and which is diſtinguiſhed from worſhip, then your objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is plainly idle, and vaine. You might ſay as well, if our Saviour had intended the word to be reverenced, he would not haue delivered it in ſuch a manner as the world ſhould eſteeme fooliſhneſſe. If our Saviour had
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:14577:162"/>

Yea you might ſay as well, if our Saviour had intended the outward meanes to be ſuch admirable helps to heaven, and of ſuch an honourable vſe in the Church, he would not haue choſen ſuch meanes as the ſupercilious world would deſpiſe for baſe, and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible. Indeed the word and Sacran ents are not to be judged by their outward excellencie and luſtre in the eye of naturall man; but by their ſpirituall vertue which the inſtitution of Chriſt hath added vnto them.

If therefore either <hi>Luke</hi> ſhall expound <hi>Matthew,</hi> or that Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to both vſed both kneeling, and falling vpon the face, then is the force of your proofe manifeſtly none at all.

But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs it inferres nothing. Yet I cannot paſſe a kinde of illuſtration, (ſuch as it is) which you vſe, ſaying; <hi>If a geſture of the greateſt reverence be futeſt, then people ſhould not preſume to receiue the Sacramentall elements with their hands, but the ſame for greater reverence ought to be put into their monthes.</hi> Anſwer. I marvaile that you doe take for graunted, that putting into the mouth is a faſhion of greater reverence, then receiving the elements with the

Wherefore Papiſts were an occaſion of our kneeling as it is an outward act, which the bodily eye doth judge of, but they mooved vs not to kneele to the elements<hi>:</hi> yea for that outward act, they were occaſion onely at that time; for they mooved vs not to kneele, as if elſe we might not haue kneeled, but onely ſtirred vs vp to vſe the benefit of our libertie, as the times, and ſeaſons ſeemed then to require. And this is a ſufficient an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, as I ſuppoſe, inaſmuch as the outward act of knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was it, which ſufficed to ſtop the mouth of calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niation, which outward act Gods word alloweth, and we might haue lawfully vſed, if the Papiſts had never beene heard of. So either of theſe two anſwers without more a doe ſhewes the vanitie of this conjecture.</p>

                     <p>For the latter, let vs ſee how you can conclude againſt <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>67</label> the Church, that by thoſe words of the Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er booke ſhe intends to commit idolatry? Firſt, it ſeemes to be thought, becauſe the Church appointed kneeling in the act of receiving for avoiding of prophaneſſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no other geſture ſufficeth in the mind and meaning of the Church, but that, for receiving the Sacrament reverently. Hereupon the Replier demaundeth, <note n="m" place="margin">Repl. partic. to Bp. <hi>Mort.</hi> pag 48.</note> whether due eſtimation of holy rites, cannot be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently teſtified without kneeling? But let any man of common reaſon conſider whether this expoſition be not moſt vnreaſonable; for by this declaring it followeth, that the Magiſtrate or Church can appoint no matter of circumſtance vpon conſideration of the fitneſſe thereof, but forſooth all other circumſtances are condemned by and by, as abſolutely vnfit. Put caſe the Magiſtrate or Church enjoyned kneeling in prayer for avoiding of prophaneſſe, (which might godlily be done) could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man juſtly ſay, that (in the mind and meaning of the Commaunders) prayer could not be therefore vſed in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther geſtures reverently? when authority limiteth the time, and the place of Gods publick worſhip, and many other circumſtances, (in kinde neceſſary) that the ſame worſhip may be decently, and orderly performed, can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man therefore juſtly ſay that other times and places, and orders, are eſteemed abſolutely indecent? Some time muſt be ſet, ſome place muſt be had, ſome orders muſt be appointed; now of many times, and places, and orders,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:14577:170"/>
which may be decently applied to Gods worſhip, ſuch a time, and ſuch a place, and ſuch other orders are limited, which the judgement of Governours can obſerue moſt fit, according to the ſtate of the Church and people. So it is for the Sacramentall geſture. The auncient appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of kneeling in this Church having all geſtures before them to determine out of, for the due, and reverent handling of the holy Sacrament, pitched vpon the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble geſture of kneeling, as which for that very purpoſe they iudged then to be the meeteſt of all others, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly did appoint it. But (to keepe you to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) what's this to make idolatry? If the requiring of kneeling, that an ordinance might be handled reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, muſt import idolatry, then ſuch requiring of knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at prayer, of ſitting bare at the Sacramentall buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for handling thoſe ordinances reverently, muſt alſo be flat idolatry; and yet (I thinke) you would allow of conſtitution of either kneeling at prayer, or ſitting bare at the Sacrament, for handling the ſaid ordinances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently. The caſe is cleere, that this exception concludes no idolatry, ſo long as the reverence intended ariſeth onely out of the ſoveraigne worſhip, which is given to God himſelfe: and whether the words of the booke make for other reverence then ſuch muſt be preſently tryed.</p>
                     <p>Againe you except againſt the words of the booke, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>68</label> preſcribing kneeling at Sacrament for avoiding propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, becauſe kneeling cannot be a remedy againſt prophaneſſe: <hi>for</hi> (ſay <note n="n" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> you) <hi>except intermiſſion</hi> (if ſuch had beene) <hi>of kneeling had beene a cauſe of prophaneſſe, which it was not, how could kneeling be a remedie.</hi> Againe, <hi>what is the cauſe that in other Churches, remedie can be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt prophaneſſe without kneeling, and not in ours?</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Great and difficult demaunds I wot! to the firſt I tell you yet againe, that intermiſſion of kneeling is not in it ſelfe any cauſe of prophaneſſe, but by accident through the weake and carnall hearts of Communicants;
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:14577:170"/>
and there is nothing more knowne then that lawes are made of reſtreining ſome indifferent things, not for the matter of the things themſelues, (for then all indifferent things ſhould be commaunded alike, that is, every man ſhould be left to doe what he will) but from the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, and circumſtance of the time. Now it is cleere that kneeling may be a remedie againſt the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall prophaneſſe, which is occaſioned through the intermiſſion of it by other geſtures. To the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, I certifie you, that other Churches are no rule to vs, more then we be vnto them; that ſome other Churches doe vſe kneeling for handling of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reverently, as well as ours; that the beſt learned, that haue beene in thoſe Churches where kneeling is not vſed, condemne it not in this Church; that thoſe Churches may haue ſuch Communicants as ſleight the Sacrament, by occaſion of the common geſtures of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking, which is not impoſſible, or improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whatſoever you ſay: laſtly, we never thought that kneeling is ſimply neceſſary for handling the Sacrament reverently, but onely that it is good and fit vnto that end, when the ſame can conveniently be applied, as phyſicall preſcriptions may be good and fit to prevent diſeaſes, whereof there is cauſe of feare, when yet there is no abſolute neceſſitie of them. <hi>But</hi> (ſay <note n="o" place="margin">Pag. 51.</note> you) <hi>phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick is not given as food, to all perſons, and at all times, whereas kneeling is ſo preſcribed in this Church.</hi> I anſwer, you doe ill preſſe againſt vs the metaphor in thoſe points, becauſe the diſcaſe of profaning the Sacrament is, (as other ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall diſeaſes are) incident to all perſons at any time; Gods word is compared to Balme in Scripture, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther phyſicall things; belike you will check the Spirit of God, for comparing the ſame to phyſick, when it is continually, and vniverſally neceſſary: but if kneeling be not requiſite to all Communicants at all times for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding of prophaneſſe, it is ſufficient that it is ſo for the moſt part, (for ſo lawes reſpect what is neeedfull gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:14577:171"/>
though not vniverſally, as ſome where elſe I haue already ſhewed) and at leaſt if prophaneſſe ſhould not fall out by other geſtures; yet kneeling oppoſeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneſſe, being a geſture of reverence in its owne nature. But (to keepe you ſtill to the matter) what's all this to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry? for what if kneeling be no more a remedie againſt profaneſſe, then ſtanding or ſitting, doth that conclude that the vſe of it is therefore idolatry? Nay if kneeling were not at all oppoſed to profaneſſe, but were it ſelfe profane, and profaned the Sacrament, (as the Diſputer <note n="p" place="margin">Diſp. pag. 164.</note> contradicting himſelfe affirmeth) I hope you would be aſhamed to conclude it to be idolatry therefore.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, if any conſideration of the words of the booke <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>69</label> can make the Churches intent therein idolatrous, it is this, that kneeling ſeemeth to be allowed, or directed to no other purpoſe, but that reverence may be given to the viſible elements. Anſwer. With this expoſition (I ſuppoſe) ſome of you pleaſe your ſelues ſo much, as if you durſt forſake your miniſteries, endure impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, exile, even death it ſelfe, for the infallibility of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone A difficult warre it is to fight againſt the ſtrength of the imagination, yet conſidering truth can and will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund obedience vnto them which loue it, I am in good hope to perſuade you to be ruled by a better commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Firſt, then what will you ſay to the rule of charity, which requireth, that all things be taken in the beſt ſenſe, <note n="q" place="margin">This proofe is thus vſed by ſome of you in a Catechiſme beginning, what ought to bee the chiefe, and continuall care of every man in this life, at expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſixt commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5, 7. Verily if this be a rule at any time, it ſpecially ſhould take place in expounding the words of that religious King of bleſſed memory, K <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> 6. and of his Directours, who helped in reforming religion in this land, and ſome of them honourable by Martyrdome. Now the words of the book may not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be interpreted in a better ſenſe then you make, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo take them in the letter as they lie, without conceits and ſurmiſes, and they be godly, not to be reprooved: for kneeling (as I haue ſufficiently manifeſted) may be lawfully vſed, that the Sacrament may be reverently cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated.
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:14577:171"/>
Secondly, by what law of God am I bound to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſoveraign worſhip in the Churches appointment, becauſe it is not expreſſed. If thoſe words of the book could not conſiſt therewith, then I confeſſe the way of comming to God in this kneeling enjoyned, had beene blocked vp<hi>:</hi> but when the reverence which the words expreſſe will plainly ſtand with ſoveraigne worſhip gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to God, (though vnmentioned) &amp; oppoſeth it not, nay may very well iſſue forth from it, what an vncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſtruction is it to exclude the ſaid ſoveraigne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the Churches meaning to make idolatry? Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, obſerue the tenour of the words themſelues, as you doe recite them, and it eaſily admits, yea ſuppoſeth ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne worſhip; for it enjoynes not to kneele vnto the bread and wine, (nay our Church abhortes to ſpeak ſo) but to vſe the reverent geſture of kneeling, that ſo the Sacrament may not be profaned, but held in a reverend and holy eſtimation amongſt vs. This context of words importeth, that this reverence of the Sacrament ariſeth from kneeling by conſequence, and comes not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto by the ſaid kneeling immediately directed vnto it. Fourthly, you tell <note n="r" place="margin">Survey p. 7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> vs, <hi>that the Atturney generall repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it to be a reſolution, according to a generall rule in law, that Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction may puniſh offences againſt the Communion-booke, otherwiſe then the statutes of</hi> 1 Eliz. c. 2. <hi>doth, becauſe that ſtatute onely affirmeth one manner of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing. and doth not deny another:</hi> where you gather, that by the ſame rule, though kneeling be affirmed, yet ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and ſtanding are lawfull, becauſe they are not deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But (whereas for deniall of ſitting and ſtanding I haue ſpoken otherwhere) it is a rule of force in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of our Church appointing to kneele, that though reverence be affirmed, ſoveraigne worſhip cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied: and here you may ſee moſt evident application of it. Fifthly, let it pleaſe you to thinke of the reaſon which your ſelues <note n="s" place="margin">Manuſcrip. ch. 1. arg. 4.</note> alledge, why thoſe words were vſed, and kneeling enjoyned, namely to ſtop the mouthes of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:14577:172"/>
who complained that the Sacrament was profaned. Surely if this be true, you might eaſily ſee that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers named outward reverence onely, becauſe there was ſtrife about it. There is no doubt, but they would haue named ſoveraigne worſhip, much more, if ſtrife had been about it, as was not. How many lawes are there, which onely mention ſuch reſpects as the time (when they were made) gaue occaſion, pretermitting ſome other, (yet not to be excluded) wherein the ſtate and exigence of the time preſſed them not? Sixthly, in all the booke of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer, you ſhall never finde, (as I take it) that whereſoever kneeling is enjoyned, (as it is enioyned often) God himſelfe is at any time expreſſely mentioned, to whom the kneeling yet, (even in your opinion of the Churches iudgement) is without queſtion intended. Wherefore you might doe well to meaſure kneeling en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned in the Sacrament by all theſe: for though there are outward, and inferiour reſpects mentioned rather in that, then in theſe, (through particular occurrence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falling) yet they be all alike ſet downe in the order of the booke, which alwayes ſuppoſeth, (as a thing moſt vnqueſtionable) that religious kneeling is directed to God being ſo notorious a geſture in the Church of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne worſhip. This conſideration might haue mooved you ſomething. Seventhly, how hard, and harſh an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is this, that whereas kneeling before the elements be received is evidently vſed to God, now being continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the act of receiving the caſe is altered, &amp; God is by no meanes to be worſhipped thereby<hi>:</hi> either this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and meaning is ſo fond, it cannot be fathered vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch wiſe men, as the auncient compilers were, or certainly we ſhould haue had a note of admonition to ſignifie the ceaſing of ſoveraigne worſhip. Eighthly, and laſtly, your owne writings will witneſſe, that kneeling is intended and vſed by our Church for worſhipping of God: for to paſſe <note n="t" place="margin">Diſp pag. 15.</note> theſe words of the Diſputer, <hi>[whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Communicants doe direct their knee-worſhip at the</hi>
                        <pb n="327" facs="tcp:14577:172"/>
                        <hi>Lords table, to God the Father in ſeverall, or ioyntly to the whole Trinitie, who can define? It is a point not as yet reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (for ought I know) by our Church]</hi> to paſſe I ſay theſe words, (which graunt as a thing not to be diſputed, that kneeling is directed to God, (either the firſt perſon, or the whole Trinity) and that noreſolution of the Church is againſt that, I muſt ſpecially put you in minde, that you contend by earneſt argument our kneeling in this Church to be a worſhipping of God. Firſt, the aforeſaid Diſputer I boureth <note n="u" place="margin">Diſp pag. 159 160.</note> earneſtly to prooue <note n="w" place="margin">Mark the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent &amp; ground of this proofe, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at pag. 155.</note> our knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a part of the Lords worſhip, and directed vnto him<hi>:</hi> but eſpecially the <hi>Abridgement</hi> ſpeaketh in this <note n="x" place="margin">Abridg. p. 42.</note> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>[kneeling in the act of receiving the bread and wine in the Lords Supper is eſteemed, impoſed, and obſerved as a part of Gods worſhip.]</hi> Wherefore out of the premiſes I dare ſay, that though kneeling be appointed by King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> booke for reverence of the Sacrament, yet ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne worſhip is not excluded, but ſuppoſed, whence the externall reverence of that holy ordinance celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in that geſture, ariſeth. And this interpretation, which you ought to make of that booke, you may doe well to make of our learned writers, who though they plead for reverence of the Sacrament, yet ever doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend that kneeling ſerveth for adoring the majeſtie of God and Chriſt. So that according to them by kneeling ſoveraigne worſhip is directed to God, and therefore the reverence which commeth to the Sacramentall ſignes and buſineſſe flowes from thence as I haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before.

Tye is to be conſidered: firſt, in reſpect of the thing whereunto we be tyed: ſecondly, in reſpect of that, by which we be tyed: thirdly, by the manner of tying.

Indeed if the thing it ſelfe be vnlawfull, as religious, and purpoſed kneeling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an image; or it be put vpon vs by them which haue nothing at all to doe with vs, as by the Pope, or the King of <hi>Spaine;</hi> or haue an opinion of neceſſity put vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, or other ſuperſtitions, when it is but a mutable circumſtance ſerving to order, and comelineſſe, then the ſecond commandement muſt needes be tranſgreſſed by ſuch a tying: but what is this to the geſture of kneeling at Sacrament?

This reaſoning of yours ſhould import that the like reverence is to be declared al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in all ordinances. Againe, you might well haue conſidered, that the Church may preſcribe a geſture of greater reverence to the Sacrament, not becauſe more reverence is due to it in it ſelfe, but becauſe it hath been moſt abaſed by words, and deeds <note n="i" place="margin">See what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idle anſwer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pl. makes to this point, Repl. par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic. to Bp. <hi>Mort.</hi> ch 3. ſect. 27. when he maks compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and the kneeling of both, belike he can prooue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling before i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages lawfull in it ſelfe; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede hee may prooue anie thing after his manner.</note> of vilifying vnreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.

Fifthly, (ſaith <note n="n" place="margin">Survey p. 75.</note> the Surveyour) <hi>The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of theſe words, The body of our Lord, &amp;c. The blood of our Lord, &amp;c. in the act of ministring the elements, may occaſion idolatry.</hi> What? Rather then the pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of thoſe words in the inſtitution of Chriſt, nay not ſo much; for in the inſtitution, the bread is called (ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally) the body of Chriſt, the wine is called his blood in plaine termes, (and that in the act of miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) whereas in this prayer is no ſuch matter<hi>:</hi> belike you would not haue the people thinke of the body, and blood, whiles the bread and wine are either ſeene, or felt by them for feare of idolatry, Sixthly, (ſayes the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyour) <note n="o" place="margin">Ibidem.</note>

Chriſt graunt vs but a drop of his Ocean, in whom are all the treaſure of wiſdome, and knowledge, but are you wiſer then Chriſt was, that will not forbeare long prayers before, and after ſermons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after the adminiſtration of both Sacraments? Moreover Chriſt is ſaid to pray for a bleſſing vpon the elements to the receivers, but what words, and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they were you cannot tell, nor how long they did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. Nay Chriſts bleſſing might be as neere his diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting, as this prayer is before our diſtributing for ought appeareth in the text; for if our Miniſters ſhould breake every Communicant his peece, or portion of bread, when he comes vnto him, and ſo breaking giue it vnto him, you can ſhew no difference in the time. And in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Cup this is more manifeſt; for Chriſt is ſaid to bleſſe the Cup, and ſo gaue it to his Apoſtles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yea. But you will ſay, <hi>Chriſt did not pronounce a prayer ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly to each Communicant.</hi> I anſwer, if he did not, yet conſidering the common bleſſing of the table belongs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>every one, and a ſeverall application thereof is to be made by every one; here is nothing done in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, but what is done, and grounded in the common bleſſing; nothing done by the Miniſter in applying the ſaid common bleſſing to the Communicant, but what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Communicant ought to doe for himſelfe: and this is truely ſubordinate to the rule of Chriſts inſtitution.

I doubt not but you will acknowledge the weakneſſe, and inconſequence of this argument: but the <hi>Manuſcript</hi> delivers this reaſon thus; <hi>Our Church and Book of Prayer vſeth not to enioyne kneeling ſo ſtrictly at any prayer.</hi> Anſwer. What ſtrictneſſe is vſed <hi>de facte</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teines not to the purpoſe: ſure I am that it is vntrue which you ſay, that the Booke vſeth not to enjoyne kneeling ſo ſtrictly at any prayer. See for example the Rubrick before the generall confeſſion in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Morning prayer. And againe the Rubrick after the Creed in Morning Prayer: and compare them with the Rubrick which is before this prayer in controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and you ſhall ſee them enjoyned with equall ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and therefore I marvell that you would accuſe the booke ſo vnjuſtly, and in ſo manifeſt a caſe. Where the <hi>Abridgement</hi> addeth, <hi>that the Booke appoints not kneeling in thoſe prayers and thanksgivings, which are appointed to be vſed both before and after the receiving of the Sacrament,</hi> it is evidently falſe. For at the firſt confeſſion and prayer, appointed to be made at the Communion, next after the exhortations there is this Rubrick, <hi>[Then ſhall this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall confeſſion be made in the name of all thoſe that are min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to receiue the holy Communion, all kneeling humbly vpon their knees.</hi> How can you looke vpon this Rubrick, and your conſciences not check you for ſaying as you doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If you ſay, that that direction is not renewed at every prayer, you require a ſuperfluous direction; for that which is ſet in the front of many prayers, is ſufficient for all that are continued together. For whereas in the generall confeſſion of Morning prayer all are appointed to kneele downe, doe you thinke the booke intends not the continuance of kneeling at the abſolution, and
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:14577:179"/>
the Lords prayer? Againe, after the Creed of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning prayer all are appointed to kneele downe at ſaying a company of verſicles, doe you thinke the ſame knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is not intended to be continued at all other prayers which ſhall be continuated vnto them? In a word it is not neceſſary that direction for kneeling ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed at every ſingular prayer, but one is enough for all ſuch prayers as by one plaine and continued conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenation are linked together. And this in reaſon and charity is to be judged the meaning of the booke, for elſe direction would be given for one prayer, and none for twenty, which to thinke were to charge the compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers vncharitably with ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And to make this to be the meaning better appeare, it is to be obſerved, that the booke is wont commonly to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, for kneeling at the firſt prayer, where many pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are together, and not at any other that follow; and though I know ſomtimes, (as at Evening praier, &amp;c. there is no expreſſe direction at all, becauſe the ſame is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the maine directions of Morning prayer, which imply the like to be done vpon like occaſions) yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, where there is direction it is ſet at the firſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as in Morning prayer before the confeſſion, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine after the Creed, againe after the exhortations at the Communion, againe before the verſicles in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of matrimony, againe in the beginning of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of viſiting the ſick, againe in the beginning of the thankſgiving for women after childbirth, againe before <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. in the commination, in all which places (beſides other) there is expreſſe direction for kneeling downe.</p>

Look the order of the Communion it ſelfe, and this will be found true even there.

of matters, and for that cauſe he is ſingularly directed, there is no cauſe to ſuſpect that that implies the like direction to the people, eſpecially when they are by name directed for themſelues when is occaſion a the like may be done in the act of receiving, for the prayer which is thereunto adjoyned; and ſo much the rather when the ſoule in the act of receiving may bee ſweetly carried vp to God in ſecret deſires according to the matter and tenour of that prayer, which ſo newly ſounded in the eare of the Communicant. And yet I would not ſtand vpon that prayer alone, but rather the continued exerciſe of prayer, whereof that is but a part, to giue occaſion of kneeling to be continued in the act of receiving, eſpecially when the time of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to one Communicant is very ſhort, and as it were but a moment, in the midſt of the ſaid exerciſe of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which the Church appointeth to be adjoyned. And yet againe as receiving is the principall imployment, and the prayer is but occaſioned thereby, it is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that ſtill the buſineſſe of receiving hath a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall ſtroke in occaſioning ſuch kneeling to be vſed, (though vſed immediately-by occaſion of prayer) as <hi>cauſa cauſae eſt cauſa cauſati.</hi>

Therfore the Church appoints not kneeling for thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. This follows not, for ſuppoſe the Sacramentall action be no action of thanksgiving properly, yet it is enough to croſſe your preſent purpoſe, that the Church doth judge it to be ſo. And that ſo it doth, appeares plentifully in the order of the Communion, as he ſhall eaſily finde that will ſearch the ſame and conſider. In the formes of diſtribution of the elements, it is thus preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed <hi>Eate this in remembrance that Chriſt dyed for thee, and feed on him in thine heart by faith with thanksgiving-Drinke this in remembrance Chriſts blood was ſhed for thee, and be thankefull.</hi> In the thankſgiving to be vſed next after the receiving is ended, it is thus ſaid: <hi>O Lord our heavenly Father, we thine humble ſervants entirely deſire thy fatherly goodneſſe mercifully to accept this our ſacrifice of praiſe and thanksgiving.</hi> Whereunto may be added that acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Therefore with Angels, &amp;c. we laud and magnifie, &amp;c.</hi> And in a word thankſgiving is mentioned and vſed continually, before, and after, and in the adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this heavenlie ſervice. And you ſhall find no ſuch paſſages in the order of Baptiſme, neither doe I ſee what could be ſaid more by any Church houlding the Sacramentall action to be a proper action of thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.

This aſſertion I haue anſwered of purpoſe, and ſhewed the falſhood of it at large, part. 2. chap. 7. ſect. 9. 10, 11. But ſuppoſe it were true, what followes vpon it? What? Therfore the Church appoints not kneeling for thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. Surely this is a <hi>Non-ſequitur,</hi> and groſſe in you, becauſe you lay ſo many faults to the charge of this Church, eſpecially intent of idolatry in receiving: for is it not abſurd to goe about to prooue the Church to doe that which ſhe ought not to doe one way, becauſe ſhe muſt doe as ſhe ought to doe another. For thus you argue, <hi>Kneeling is not the fitteſt geſture for thanksgiving, therefore the Church would not appoint it as Sacrament for thanksgiving.</hi> You might as well haue reaſoned in this manner, and much better alſo. Kneeling for idolatrous reverence of the elements is an abominable thing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church would not appoint it for ſuch idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous reverence. Your part was to prooue the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches intent of kneeling not to be for thankſgiving, whether kneeling bee fit in thankſgiving or vnfit. And becauſe you ſay nothing to that, I will giue the godly Reader to conſider of the Rubrick directing to kneeling compared with the formes of diſtribution of the elements named before, <hi>The people ſhall haue the bread and wine delivered vnto them kneeling,</hi> ſayes the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, and then followeth-Take <hi>and eate-with thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-drinke this and be thankefull.</hi> I deſire that this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration may be duely thought on.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, (ſay <note n="d" place="margin">Manuſer. ch. 1. arg. 4.</note> you) <hi>Though kneeling ſhould be a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture</hi>

It is true, it is enough for vs, that kneeling may be lawfullie vſed, though not alwaies neceſſarilie, yet if any bleſſing of God require humble thankfulneſſe,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:14577:186"/>
it is the bleſſing of Chriſt himſelfe: alſo the Sacramentall employment is Gods publick &amp; ſolemne worſhip, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as that bleſſing is not to be compared with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall, and ordinarie mercies; ſo this employment giues free libertie of worſhipping, then ſome occaſions, times, places, (as you inſtance in market places, and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping before <hi>Nebuchadnezzar:</hi> idol, and the Breaden God, yea and I may adde many others of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then they) would allow vnto vs. But what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes of this Antecedent? What? Therefore the Church appoints not kneeling for thankſgiving. This is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence like the former, nay worſe becauſe the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent giveth kneeling to be fit and lawfull in thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving ſometimes<hi>:</hi> and therefore the Church might more probably appoint it in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, (ſay <note n="e" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> you) <hi>The Books of Common Prayer</hi> 
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>88</label> 
                        <hi>commaunds vs not to kneele at any other thanksgiving: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it requires not kneeling here for thanksgiving.</hi> Anſwer. I deny the Antecedent, which I ſhew to be falſe by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the booke. Firſt all the thankſgivings at the end of the Letanie, which are ſixe in number are to be ſaid in the geſture preſcribed in the beginning of the prayers next after the Creed. Againe the thankſgiving of women after childbirth is appointed to be performed in the geſture of kneeling, and this is a ſpeciall and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne thankſgiving. If you ſay the woman is directed onely to kneele downe, and not the Miniſter, you muſt conſider the caſe is like in the geſture of receiving, where the Miniſter is not to kneele, when he is employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the particular behalfe of the Communicants, but they alone. So this is a cleere and evident inſtance to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute you when you ſay that the booke commaunds not to kneele at any thankſgiving. I may adde that in the order of the Communion, the ſame direction that is for kneeling at certaine confeſſions and petitions, is plainly of force for ſundry thankſgivings that are inſerted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. And theſe inſtances may ſuffice, then your
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:14577:186"/>
conſequence is not ſound, and convincing, becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thankſgivings in the booke be vocall, and this Sacramentall thankſgiving is reall, or an acting of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and if there be the ſame reaſon of both, yet that may be appointed once vpon one occaſion, that is not appointed againe, though the ſame occaſion fall out againe<hi>:</hi> as ſtanding is appointed at the Creed of Morning prayer, commonly called the Creed of the Apoſtles, and yet is not appointed at the ſame Creed in the order of the Communion, nor againe at the Creed of <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> So much for anſwer to your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, (ſuch as they are) to ſhew that the Church en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes not kneeling at Sacrament for thankfull remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Chriſts ſufferings.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, you indeavour to ſhew, that the Church enjoynes not kneeling at Sacrament for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>89</label> gift that therein is beſtowed vpon vs. <hi>Kneeling</hi> (ſay <note n="f" place="margin">Diſp. 163. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. pag. 44. Manuſcr. ch. 1. arg 4.</note> you) <hi>is not appointed for worſhipping in reſpect of the gift, which we receive in the Sacrament, for then ſhould we alſo be required to kneele in the time of Sermons, and in the adminiſtration of Baptiſme.</hi> Anſwer. Firſt I might anſwer, that the Church condemns not kneeling at the hearing of the word, as in the receiving of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and other portions of Scripture, (which I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before) by the Booke of Common prayer appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, nay condemnes it not even in Sermon time, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in women, who kneele every where vſually then, without ſo much as (I ſay not expoſtulation) but que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion once made or mooved about it. And as much might be ſaid of Baptiſme, that the Church condemnes not kneling in that ordinance, as it appointeth it not<hi>:</hi> and it might well haue appointed it, if there had beene occaſion; for what occaſion is there to preſcribe a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture vnto ſuch as are baptized amongſt vs; for when you ſay we are appointed to kneele at the Supper, and not at Baptiſme, you muſt not compare receivers in the one, with lookers on in the other, but Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:14577:187"/>
at the Lords Supper with the Baptized in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, ſuch as are onely children in our aſſemblies. Well then and doe you not ſee, that the Church could dot limit a geſture for infants of a weeke olde? Doe you not ſee that no reſpect could or can be had vnto the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture in ſuch? If this be evident, (as it is) your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of our Churches iniunction of the Supper-geſture with Baptiſme, (where no geſture can be enjoyned) argues a great deale of inconſideration. I doubt not but this anſwer will giue good ſatisfaction vnto others, whatſoever it will doe to you.</p>
                     <p>But let it be, that there is an evident difference in the <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>90</label> Churches impoſition, requiring kneeling at the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, and not in the exerciſe of the word and Baptiſme, what followeth of that? What? That the Church en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes not kneeling at Sacrament for the gift which is beſtowed vpon the Communicants therefore? Make this inference good, and you ſhall doe a great worke of wonder. For there is no man ſo beſides himſelfe to thinke, that we are bound to kneele, whenſoever we receive a gift from God, for then we ſhould kneele con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually; onelie we ſay that it is lawfull to kneele vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that reſpect, when the circumſtances doe ſerue ſo to doe conveniently. Now you know the times when kneeling was enjoyned in King <hi>Edwards</hi> Raigne, did giue occaſion that it ſhould be impoſed in the Supper, rather then in the exerciſe of the word and Baptiſme. It is true the reſpect of a gift may be common to the word and Sacraments, and therefore may warrant kneeling in it ſelfe in them all; but yet accidentall occaſion may make the geſtures to differ. So when we kneele, we kneele for this reſpect of a gift, but we are not alwaies bound to kneele vpon this reſpect, as it is in the Lords prayer, when we pray, <hi>Giue vs,</hi> it is lawfull to kneele, yet not ever neceſſarie, and if a man may leaue ſuch a geſture, which is vſed vpon ſuch reſpect as is perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the ſame ordinance; he may doe it much more
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:14577:187"/>
in that which is diverſe, as I haue ſhewed ſomewhere elſe before. Beſides, though the word &amp; Sacraments haue all a conſideration of being gifts, yet the Church might think the Euchariſt a more ſpeciall gift, then either the word or Baptiſme, not abſolutely, but for the ſymboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call manner of communication. For behold the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſticall elements are not onely a viſible pledge of Gods favour, and ſeale of his covenant, but alſo a viſible of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and tender of Chriſts owne body and blood, which is the moſt expreſſe and liuely Symbole of Chriſt, that the Church enioyeth, yea and the ſame delivered vnto vs in a ſenſible manner, gift-wiſe, in the proper and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward guiſe of giving a gift, ſo as the word and Baptiſme are not. Now what if hereupon the Church enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned difference in the geſture, I meane vpon the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the difference of the gifts in the manner of exhibition, then your conſequence is quite ſpoiled, veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he which compareth the order of adminiſtration of the Euchariſt, and Baptiſme together ſhall eaſily ſee, that the Church eſteemes of them vnlike as gifts: So, that kneeling is enioyned at Sacrament to worſhip God for the gift of Chriſts body and blood is evident, by that paſſage of the forme of diſtribution, to be ſaid, when the Communicant is vpon his knees ready to receiue the ſigne <hi>[the body of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt which was giuen for thee]</hi> which word is alſo vſed by our Saviour himſelfe in the Inſtitution.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, I muſt charge you with contradiction <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>91</label> to your ſelues by making of this exception; for if it bee true, that we be not appointed to worſhip God for the excellency of the gift, and yet (as your intent is to proue) to worſhip the excellent gift, then the Church would haue haue enioyned aſmuch in the word and Baptiſme, that though not the giver for the gifts, yet thoſe gifts ſhould haue bin worſhipped as well as the Euchariſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call; nay becauſe the Church appoynts no Idolatrous worſhipping of the word, and Baptiſme, which you ſay
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:14577:188"/>
are as much to be honoured, as the Euchariſt, according to your reaſoning it muſt needes follow, that the Church intended not to giue divine worſhip, vnto the Euchariſticall Elements, as if there were ſome intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call excellency therein, which did ſingularly require vs to kneele downe vnto them. And ſo indeed kneeling falls to be appoynted with vs in one Sacrament onely, vpon particular occaſion of the preſent times, and yet in it ſelfe is lawfull in the other alſo as well, ſo that if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that publick occaſion of kneeling at Euchariſt had not been, or anſwerable occaſion in <note n="g" place="margin">Suppoſing that men of yeeres were baptized with vs.</note> Baptiſme had been, the geſture in both might haue been appoynted the ſame without difference. See more anſwere backe Sect. 74.</p>
                     <p>And now I haue preſented all your conceits together, <label type="milestone">

But what if it were ſo, let the Diſputer anſwer himſelfe for me in the next words to the former.

                        <pb n="353" facs="tcp:14577:188"/>
So then by Gods gracious help I haue iuſtly vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>93</label> this Church, from your vncharitable, and vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable ſlander. And is this all that you can charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church in this matter? Is this the part of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men to accuſe her ſo expreſſely in the face of the world, that her intent in impoſing kneeling is Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, and make no proofe other then a company of ſuch trifling collections? If you had bin as zealous on the other hand, you might and would haue gathered many things to confute this imagination more cleerely. What if you would haue vſed the Homily againſt perill of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry at this time?

                     <p>FIrſt, in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes there was a proteſtation <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>94</label> added in the Booke of prayer, to cleere the geſture from adoration: this Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi>

                        <hi>taken kneeling away, but for the ſway of the times, and yet they did not lay aſide their purpoſe ſo to doe, but waited a fit opportunity, and vſed the beſt meanes they could to compaſſe, and accompliſh the ſame.</hi> Put now both theſe aſſertions together, and it is evident the firſt compilers of the booke were expreſſe adverſaries to idolatrous reverence of the bread and wine: And though kneeling was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, as the time ſeemed then to require, yet their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion and intent in impoſing thereof was contrarie to that which you pleaſe vnchriſtianly to accuſe them of. Moreover doth not (I ſpeake in the words of the <note n="m" place="margin">Survey 182.</note> Surveyour) the 29. Article of Religion, (as it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in King <hi>Ewards</hi> Raigne, and whereunto ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is required, by 13. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 12.) ſay, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſts bodie is not by his ordinance to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped. I adde that in one of the Rubricks after the Communion it is ſaid. <hi>To take away the ſuperſtition which any perſon hath or might haue in the bread and wine, it ſhall be ſuch bread, as is vſuall to be eaten at the Table with other meates.</hi> Yea the Surveyour <note n="n" place="margin">In the Quere of kneeling at the end of his booke.</note> hath ſpent a great many leaues to ſhew the godly intent of the ſtate in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> how farre they were from purpoſe of impoſing ſuperſticious kneeling. Hitherto may be referred much that I haue ſpoken chap. 1. of the Churches enjoyning kneeling as a thing indifferent as other geſtures are without any ſuperſticious opinion put vpon it. In a word the geſture is enjoyned for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reverence to the Sacrament, then ſuch as other rites and geſtures are in all holy ordinances, the ſame being intended in common for Gods glory, and the edifying of the Church, and (intended in common) for the due reverence of Chriſts holie myſteries, and Sacraments, at appeareth, 1 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 2. and I haue fully cleered this in this chapter alreadie.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, beſides the teſtimonies of the Church is <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>95</label> ſelfe, who cannot conſider that kneeling in our Church cannot be appointed and directed to the bread and
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:14577:189"/>
wine: for this is plaine that the controverſie betwixt vs is of the geſture to be vſed in the act of eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and therefore we haue ſeene before, that you will by no meanes allow this kneeling in controverſie to be vſed for any part of the praier ſaid in the time of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, becauſe the praier is ended before the bread and wine are received; but what ſpeake I of this paſſage, all your arguments doe import as much, the queſtion is laid downe by your ſelues no otherwiſe but of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture in the act of eating, and drinking. Is it credible now that our Church appoints kneeling to be vſed for worſhipping of the bread and wine, whiles the bread is torne with the teeth, and both bread and wine paſſe into the ſtomack, and are about to be ſwallowed? Is this worſhipping poſſible? or is it not abſurd? You may as well thinke our Church would ſtand vpon worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the elements, when they be paſſed into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as when they be thus in paſſing, at leaſt for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſpace of time, if you ſay the Church enjoynes kneeling for idolatrous reverence of the elements, when they be before vs, beſides that you caſt off the point of the controverſie, who doth not ſee, that ſuch kneeling before the act of receiving may godlily be referred to the praier to be made by the Miniſter and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, which are appointed to haue continuance till the act of receiving take place? But for the act of eating and drinking, that the Church intends idolatrous reverence, then to be done to the elements in our mouthes and ſtomacks, it ſeemes too too harſh to affirme, the Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note n="o" place="margin">Diſp. pag. 61.</note> defending for the Church, that ſhe enioynes no abſurdities, or impoſſibilities.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if the Churches intent be idolatrous in her <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>96</label> kneeling at Sacrament, how can it be lawfull for you to partake with her in the celebration thereof, when and where the ſame is done, according to her idolatrous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and appointment? If the Miniſter commit idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and moſt of the Congregation commit idolatry, and
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:14577:190"/>
ſo the Sacrament is an idol to them, there is danger ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that you cannot ſay, <hi>The bread which we breake is the Communion of the body of Chriſt, for we being many are one body, being all partakers of one bread,</hi> as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16, 17. or elſe that you are partakers of the generall idolatry of the Congregation in ſome meaſure. And then you muſt either pronounce your ſelues to be guilty, or this Church to be innocent.</p>
                     <p>Finally, I would I were worthie to requeſt you to <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>97</label> looke to your owne ſelues a little in this point, for as whiles you call and account holy worſhip idolatrous which is not, you tranſgreſſe the ſecond commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a great degree: ſo when you lay the ſame ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry to the charge of the Church to which you are ſo much bound, you violate the ſecond table in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, both by injuſtice and by vnthankfulneſſe. I pray God to perſuade you, to repentance to himſelfe ward, and to make ſome part of a mends vnto the Church, (remembring that you ought to doe it, if you had one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinned againſt a private perſon) eſpecially having ſo publickly traduced the Church, as guilty of moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable and deteſtable whoredome, when ſhe is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent: I am contented that her old accuſers be now jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and truly dare appeale to ſuch of them, as are wiſe, and not led by prejudice. And hitherto of this chapter; and ſo of your arguments, tending to ſhew that kneeling is againſt pietie, taken from the manner of the Churches enjoyning. Yet one tending to ſhew the ſame thing doth remaine, taken from the practiſe of the Papiſts who haue ſo defiled this geſture, (as you ſay) that without impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we cannot vſe it<hi>:</hi> hereunto therefore let vs deſcend with hearts in writing, and reading ſo affected, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes both the truth it ſelfe, and them alſo which ſearch into it: and the God of all wiſedome and mercy direct me in handling the ſame with all faithfulneſſe.</p>

                     <p>I muſt begin with the Propoſition, explicating the <label type="milestone">

Levit. 19. 27. 28. Thus much you ſay concerning Ceremonious actions of Idolatours, wherein it is vnlawfull to be conformable vnto them.</p>
                     <p>Now to the parts of your Propoſition, I will ſay ſome <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> thing applying your proofes in order vnto them. And firſt you lay it downe of ſuch ceremonyes onely which man hath deviſed. But what may be ſaid to be deviſed by man? In ſubſtances, man deviſeth onely the <hi>forme</hi> &amp; <hi>vſe,</hi> but not the <hi>matter,</hi> which is the worke-manſhip of God himſelfe. In actions, bodily abillities, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances are naturall, and of God, in whom we liue and mou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e; onely the intent and reſpect, where on ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are carried, may be mans deviſing. Looke vpon your proofes againe, and iudge what kind of deviſes are condemned by them. In ſubſtantiall things, there was the Idolit ſelfe, which was the obiect of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:14577:192"/>
and then thoſe munericall, or individuall comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that pertained vnto it. The greateſt part of your proofes doe ſpeake of the Idoll it ſelfe onely. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements were of two ſortes, either ornaments of the Idols, or inſtruments of idolatrous worſhip. Some of which were no deviſes of men, but the good creatures of God, as the meates ſacrificed to Idols; and therefore, what I beſeech you make they among your proofes, that are excluded of purpoſe by the very firſt paſſages of your Propoſition? Eſpecially when the Lord evidently allows of them out of the caſe of ſcandall, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing idolatrous pollution. <hi>Rom,</hi> 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8 <hi>ch.</hi> 10. 25 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And of this ſort are the materialls of Idols appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are not forbidden vnto vs, as I ſhall ſhew by and by. All the reſt of your Scriptures ſpeake of meere deviſes, and inventions of wicked men, of purpoſe inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the acting of curſed idolatry; partly informing vnlawfull ornaments and inſtruments, which are called in Scripture the worke of their owne hands, and partly in the damnable application thereof, to the ſervice of abominable idols; which could not be done, without prophaning and deſtroying Gods owne holy truth and worſhip. In the idolatrous actions, which the Scriptures quoted by you doe condemne, what can you ſee, but that which all godly people will condemne, without queſtion or heſitation? For there is no one of thoſe Scriptures, that forbids to doe ſuch actions in Gods worſhip as otherwiſe were lawfull, but onely to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with heatheniſh and idolatrous worſhip<hi>:</hi> let the places be conſidered particularly. <hi>Thou ſhalt not bow downe to their Gods, nor ſerue them, nor doe after their works, but thou ſhalt vtterly overthrow them, and quite breake downe their images.</hi> Exod. 23. 24. <hi>You ſhall overthrow their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, and breake their pillars, and burne their groues with fire, and you ſhall hew downe the graven images of their Gods, and deſtroy the names of them out of that place: Ye ſhall not doe ſo vnto the Lord your God.</hi> Deut. 12. 3, 4. <hi>Take heed to</hi>
                        <pb n="361" facs="tcp:14577:192"/>
                        <hi>thy ſelfe that thou be not ſnared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee, and that thou enquire not after their Gods, ſaying, How did theſe Nations ſerue their Gods? Even ſo will I doe likewiſe. Thou ſhalt not dot ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord thy God: for every abomination, which the Lord hateth, haue they done vnto their Gods; for even their ſonnes and their daughters haue they burnt in the fire to their Gods.</hi> Deut. 12. v. 30, 31. <hi>They reiected the Lords Statutes, and teſtimonies, and followed vanitie, &amp; became vayne, and went after the Heathen that were round about them, concerning whom the Lord had charged them, that they ſhould not doe like them. And they left all the commandements of the Lord their God, and made them molten images, even two Calues, and made a groue, and worſhipped all the hoſt of heaven, and ſerved Baal, and they cauſed their ſonnes and their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to paſſe through the fire, and vſed divination &amp; inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſold themſelues to doe evill in the ſight of the Lord to provoke him to anger. Therefore the Lord was very angry, &amp;c.</hi> 2 King. 17. v. 15. 16, 17, &amp;c. <hi>After the doings of the Land of Aegypt, wherein ye dwelt ſhall ye not doe, and after the doings of the Lond of Canaan, whither I bring you ſhall yee not doe, neither ſhall yee walke in their ordinances, ye ſhall therefore keep my Statutes and my indgements: you ſhall vſe no vnlawfull marriages, or luſts, nor ſuffer your ſeed to paſſe through the fire to</hi> Molech: <hi>for in all theſe things the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are defiled, and all theſe abominations haue the men of the Land done: Therefore ſhall ye keep mine Ordinance, that yee commit not any of theſe abominable cuſtomes, which were committed before you.</hi> Levit. 18. 3, &amp;c<hi>:</hi> reade the whole chapter. Behold, it is an evident thing, that all theſe Scriptures (ſetting aſide civill vncleanneſſes) only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid vnto the people of God, heatheniſh and Idolatrous manner of worſhipping, which manner doth reſpect both an Idol-obiect of worſhipping, and alſo ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, as are ſimply wicked, and could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be vſed to God himſelfe.

And ſo their making of the ſaid Serpent an idoll was (in ſpirituall conſtruction) as much as making it (in its outward forme) to be an idol. And ſo this place of 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18 4. is equivalent to the reſt of your quotations, vſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme your Propoſition, condemning images, groues, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, and other appurtenances of fille worſhip; but to theſe Scriptures I neede not make a further anſwer in this place, becauſe the purpoſe of your amplification whereto they ſerue doth not require it.</p>

Your aſſertion ſpeakes of ceremonies, where the forme whereby they were i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous is taken away, and are no otherwiſe faulty, but becauſe they haue beene aforetime, or preſently are <hi>by others,</hi> abuſed to idolatry, themſelues being applied to Gods owne lawfull worſhip.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, your propoſition is made of thoſe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> that are now of no neceſſary vſe in the Church<hi>:</hi> but what things doe you meane to be neceſſary? I know no ceremony that is neceſſary with an abſolute neceſſitie; but all ceremonies, things, actions, faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (let them be what ceremonies you will) are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at all times for ever. It is true, ſome ceremonies are neceſſarie in their kinde, though they be not neceſſarie at all, in the determination of this or that particular, thereunto belonging; as place is neceſſarie, but ſo is not ſuch a particular Church or Chappell. Time is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:14577:194"/>
but ſo is not ſuch a particular houre of the day. Water, and bread, and wine in the Sacraments are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, but ſo is not the particular water of ſuch or ſuch a ſpring or ſtreame, the bread of ſuch a manner of wheate, the wine of ſuch a Country or manner. Clothes are neceſſarie, but ſo is not ſuch a particular garment, of this or that faſhion or colour. Now if your Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be meant of ceremonies, no neceſſarie only in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular determination, it is a moſt falſe one, as you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not denie. For there is hardly any manner of place, time, ſpring, or ſtreame, graine, or grape, garment of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever faſhion or colour, which hath not beene abuſed idolatrouſly even in our owne land, and in this ſenſe it is contrary to all the Scriptures, which you quote; for they can condemne no places of worſhip, altars, pillats, veſſells, ornaments, jewells, meates, but that alone, which is idolatrouſly abuſed in the ſervice of idols, and not any other. Wherefore your ceremonies, [of no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie vſe] muſt needes be thoſe alone, which are [not neceſſarie in reſpect of the kinde of them.]</p>

And firſt I will try them by the three parts of your Propoſition, and then by all the places of Scripture, which you quote. Firſt therefore, it is a manifeſt thing, that man hath not deviſed naturall geſtures, but God in nature hath diſpoſed, and ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our bodies vnto them. I hope you will eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto this; onely perhaps you will ſay, that although the Lord hath appointed naturall geſtures, yet the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applying
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:14577:194"/>
thereof may be mans deviſing. But that will prooue a poore evaſion, as it is eaſie to manifeſt: for firſt then, this paſſage in your Propoſition, <hi>[as man hath deviſed]</hi> diſtinguiſheth not from Gods outward ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, the matter whereof may be applied, and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled amiſſe, as well as naturall geſtures. But I dare ſay you intended ſome further thing by that paſſage, when you laid it downe. Secondly, then that paſſage is a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſage in your Propoſition, for your laſt clauſe would haue ſufficed, (not onely becauſe the meere deviſes of man cannot be of neceſſarie vſe in the Church, which makes it more then needeth howſoever, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that cannot be miſapplyed to this or that part of divine worſhip, that is of neceſſarie vſe vnto it, and may not be omitted. Thirdly, then your Propoſition is graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to haue no force againſt geſtures, but as ſuppoſing the ſame to be miſapplied. I hope the godly Reader will be carefull to minde this. Laſtly, although it be true, that geſtures may be miſapplied through certain occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and circumſtances, yet no maine geſture, (for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſuch God hath appointed to be ſerviceable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe) can be <note n="s" place="margin">As I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, part. 1 ch. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Of this you can render no reaſon<hi>:</hi> for if ſtanding be polluted to vs by their idolatry, then alſo is ſitting, if ſitting, then alſo is kneeling, and ſo conſequently if any one be polluted, that we cannot vſe it, then alſo is every one; and if Popiſh idolatry can pollute thoſe vnto vs in one kinde of worſhip, then alſo in every kinde. For ſo I am aſſured you make no doubt, that as the Papiſts haue polluted all their worſhip with damnable idolatry, ſo they haue accordingly defiled all the geſtures by ſuch their polluted worſhip. Nay vnto their Sacrament of the Altar, all maine geſtures haue beene applied, both ſtanding, (which the Prieſt doth vſe) and ſitting, (which the Pope doth vſe) and knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, (which is the common geſture of the people.) If now you anſwer, that one geſture is allowed by God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe and not another, you renounce the force of the argument, taken from Popiſh idolatry<hi>:</hi> if ſuch or ſuch a geſture be vnlawfull in it ſelfe, how idly doe you vſe this argument to condemne it? As if you ſhould reaſon thus<hi>:</hi> [That which is abominable in it ſelfe we may not doe when it is polluted with Popiſh idolatry:] which Propoſition, if the ſame but vnderſtood it ſelfe, would be content (if it could) to bluſh in your behalfe. You ſhould make this argument taken from Popiſh ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry to conclude effectually againſt a thing otherwiſe lawfull of its owne ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the laſt clauſe of your Propoſition concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <label type="milestone">

<pb n="367" facs="tcp:14577:195"/>
in Scripture, and nature. Then they are reſpectiuely neceſſarie, as being orderly, comely, and commodious. Now many times when we doe vrge the lawfulneſſe of our Temples, Bells, Fonts, &amp;c. continued from idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to vs, your common <note n="t" place="margin">Demaund. pa. 28, 29. <hi>Sic et a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lij.</hi>
                        </note> anſwer is this, that ſuch things may be continued notwithſtanding Popiſh idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as are either naturall, or orderly, or decent, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. What? and is there any thing, whereof this can be ſaid more truely, then of naturall geſtures? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you will ſtill be glad to ſay geſtures are neceſſary in divine worſhip, but ſome particular geſture is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes neceſſarie. Anſwer. If you ſpeake of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, no particular geſture is neceſſarie by Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement at any time, and ſo the condition of all geſtures is alike in that reſpect; if you ſpeake of reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue neceſſitie, any particular geſture is neceſſarie by Gods allowance at any time, being naturall, (and more or leſſe) orderly, decent, and profitable in divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and ſo the condition of all geſtures is ſtill alike in this reſpect alſo. See before, Sect. 7. Wherefore this laſt clauſe of your Propoſition perteines not at all to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall geſtures in Gods worſhip, as ſtanding, ſitting, or kneeling, except as the ſame dependeth vpon a falſe ſuppoſition, as the other parts of the Propoſition doe in like manner. Thus I haue tryed the geſtures with the three parts of your Propoſition; now let vs try them by all the places of Scripture which you quote, and that the more mindfully, becauſe all the foreſaid parts of your Propoſition doe depend vpon them.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, many of your proofes are for deſtruction of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, and images themſelues, which were objects of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>12</label> I hope you are not ſo forſaken of your ſelues, from thence to conclude againſt geſtures; this were a pretty inference: Idols and images muſt be deſtroyed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is vnlawfull to vſe ſuch or ſuch a geſture reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the aboliſhment of a ſubſtantiall idol-object of worſhip to naturall geſtures, which haue ever beene,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:14577:196"/>
and ever will be common to the worſhip of damnable i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, with that of the true God: I will not doe you or my ſelfe ſo much wrong, as to goe about to refute ſuch a groſſe and ſenſeleſſe in conſequence. Nay rather I will preſent you with an amphfication from the law of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying idols and images. againſt your ſelues. Looke vpon your quotations, and you ſhall obſerue them ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of artificiall objects, of idolatrous worſhip onely: the images and idols to be deſtroyed were the workes of mens hands, and not the naturall and innocent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God. See now, if ever any created thing ſhould haue beene caſhered, it ſhould haue beene that ſame, which man had made an expreſſe idol of formall-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, for a more abominable vſe, the creature cannot be put to. Yet created things, though worſhipped thus i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrouſly God would not to be deſtroyed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much leſſe ſhould a naturall geſture be made vile, having beene abuſed onely as a meanes to worſhip the creature. If any thinke, that thoſe creatures onely ſhould haue beene ſpared, which were partly out of mans po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and partly of durable neceſſitie, as the Sun, Moone, Starres, &amp;c. but nor ſuch as increaſed or multiplied in the ayre, earth, or water, if they could be gotten, I will not now diſpute; for though I yeeld that yet I ſhall not want the benefit of mine amplification againſt you, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as if a creature made an idol of worſhip was to be deſtroyed, yet other creatures of the ſame ſort were not to be deſtroyed, but that ſingular one alone: whereas the geſtures which are vſed in holy worſhip cannot be the ſame with the abuſed geſtures of idolaters, but are onely the ſame ſort or manner that they were. Nay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther geſtures haue the two reſpects, for which the Sun, Moone, and Starres are not to be deſtroyed; for as ſuch geſtures as are vſed by others already be out of our reach ſo geſtures be of durable neceſſitie to mankind for ever.</p>
                     <p>Next, the reſt of your proofes concerning Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes ſubſtances, are of thoſe complements that partci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <label type="milestone">

vnto the Idol<hi>:</hi> according to my diviſion before ſect. 5. I will firſt touch vpon the ornaments of the Idol: and two places you quoute apperteining to them. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 30. 22. <hi>Thou ſhalt defile the covering of thy grauen images of ſilver, and the ornament of thy moulten images of gould, thou ſhalt caſt them away as a menstrous cloth: thou ſhalt ſay vnto it, get thee hence.</hi> And Gen. 35. 4. <hi>They gaue vnto</hi> Iacob <hi>all their earings</hi> [which they wore probably in their eares in honor of their ſtrange Gods] <hi>and Iacob hid them vnder an Oake.</hi> Giue me now leaue to demaund of you, whether thoſe coverings, garment; and earings belonged to the ſervice firſt of the true God? If they did not, then they make not againſt the geſtures, which from the beginning vniverſally thereunto belonged? whether thoſe coverings, garment, and earings, were not artificiall things? If they were, then they make not againſt the geſtures, which are plainly naturall: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe coverings, garments, and earings, were not the individualls, which ſerved vnto the idol? If they were, they make not againſt our geſtures, which are onely of the ſame manner with the geſtures of idolaters, and are not the ſame individualls, whether the Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of thoſe coverings, garments, and earings, ſtood not in this, that they ſerved the idol, and were vſed for the honour thereof? If it was ſo, they make nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the geſtures, of which the queſtion is onely made, as they are applyed to Gods owne worſhip, and are vſed for the honour of his owne Majeſty. And laſtly, whether there be the ſame reaſon for an action, or carriage of common vſe to Gods worſhip, as of a ſubſtance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vſe to ſome idol? If there be not, what are idols ornaments to Gods worſhip-geſtures? When you haue pondered vpon theſe demaunds, I am deceived of your judgement, if you thinke notwithſtanding, by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which ſpeake againſt the ornaments of idols, to make ſomething againſt naturall geſtures. And the ſame anſwer alſo ſufficeth for the inſtruments of idolatrous
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:14577:197"/>
worſhip, which your other quotations condemne; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly idolatrous places, groues, Altars, and veſſels: from which to gather any thing againſt geſtures, in Gods owne worſhip, is as much as from the ſtewes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and all their inſtruments of vncleanneſſe, to conclude againſt the ſinging of Larks in a Summers morning.</p>
                     <p>And yet I will giue you a further anſwer: all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>14</label> of idolatrous worſhip are condemned by God; but in what reſpects were they condemned? I ſuppoſe there are only two reſpects, that can be conceived, for which God condemnes thoſe complements of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous worſhip, the one when or where the Idol it ſelfe ſtood in force, as they were actually ſerviceable to him and his worſhip, the other, when, or where the Idol it ſelfe was caſhered, as they were monuments of idolatry; now it behooues vs to ſee how the ſame condemnation in either of theſe wayes, belongeth vnto the geſtures. The former can haue no place in our diſputation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſpeake of geſtures (not which are vſed in falſe and idolatrous worſhip but) which are applyed and vſed in the Lords owne holy worſhip, and therefore I ſhall need to ſay no more vnto that poynt. The latter giues vs occaſion to queſtion, whether naturall geſtures can be truely ſaid to be monuments of idolatry, and I diſproue it in this manner. No ordinance of God can be a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Idolatry: but all geſtures are Gods ordinances, and his outward worſhip conſiſts in them, and therefore they cannot be monuments of idolatry. <note n="u" place="margin">Demaund. p. 20, 21.</note> No creature of God can be a monument of idolatry, but all geſtures are Gods creatures, or abilities whereunto man is diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by creation, and therefore they cannot be monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of idolatry. Nothing <note n="w" place="margin">Veſſels of the Temple pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted were reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Eur. 1. 7.</note> which is taken from Gods worſhip, (whereunto himſelfe had appointed, and allowed it) applied to falſe worſhip can be a monument of idolatry: but all geſtures were transferred from Gods worſhip to idolatry by plaine theft, and vnjuſt alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his title and intereſt: and therefore they cannot
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:14577:197"/>
be monuments of Idolatry, nothing which is vſed commonly and indifferently in true and falſe worſhip both, can be a monument of falſe worſhip, or of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry: but all geſtures are vſed commonly and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently in true, and falſe worſhip both, therefore they cannot be monuments of Idolatry. Nothing which hath commoditie, and needfull vſe in Gods worſhip can be a monument of Idolatry, but all geſtures haue commodity, and needfull vſe in Gods worſhip, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot be monuments of idolatry. Nothing which Idolators never did defile, can be a monument of Idolatry, but the geſtures which Chriſtians vſe in the true Church, Idolaters never did defile, (for to the pure their owne geſtures are pure) therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be monuments of Idolatry. Nothing the abolition whereof inferrs the deſtruction of Gods outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or of any part thereof can be a monument of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; but the aboliſhing of all geſtures inferrs the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Gods outward worſhip, and the aboliſhing of one geſture inferrs the deſtruction of ſome part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, therefore they cannot be monuments of Idolatry. Finally, there is no place in the old or new Teſtament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that can be brought forth, ſo much as looking toward the proofe of this, that naturall geſtures may be monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Idolatry.</p>
                     <p>Nay I will ſay more, thoſe very complements of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>15</label> worſhip condemned by God, were not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned by him. I cannot vnderſtand but they were allowed vpon 2 conditions. The firſt, if there were a needfull vſe of them in Gods worſhip. The other, if there were no wicked vſe of them to Gods diſhonour or mans owne harme, and miſchiefe. For the firſt, on this condition they might remaine, if they were ſerviceable and needfull to Gods owne worſhip: this your ſelues do like well of; for vnder this conſideration, you ſhewed the lawfulneſſe of our Temples, Bells, &amp;c. Becauſe (ſay you) they be of needfull vſe to Gods worſhip,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:14577:198"/>
yea your Propoſition makes exception (in all your proofes alledged) of ſuch idolatrous things, as are of neceſſary vſe in the Church, and what is this againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall geſtures, I pray? Are artificiall things more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the Church, then natural? Doth the law diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with Temples, and Bells, &amp;c. when they may be conveniently ſerviceable to true worſhip, and will it not much more diſpenſe with ſtanding, ſitting, or kneeling? That is vnreaſonable Divinity.</p>
                     <p>Now I will come to the other conditions, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> the evill vſe of Idols appurtenances; and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of them is this, the ſame might be ſpared in caſe they were ſo altered and diſpoſed, as that they tended not to the honour of the Idol and his damnable wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: for looke into the tenour of the law, there the Lord commands to deſtroy Idolatours Pillars, Places, Groues, and Altars, to the end no honour might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vnto idols by the remembrance of them: <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 3. Now it is not meant, that there ſhould be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance at all, (for the Calfe which <hi>Moſes</hi> ground to duſt, and <hi>Baal,</hi> in the extirpation of whom great zeale was vſed by ſundry men; and the Idols of many Nations are recorded vnto poſterity, and remembred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this day) but this is meant, there ought to be nothing left of the idols which tended to the honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of them. Marke therefore God commands to roote out ſo much as the name or memoriall of Idols, and what could be commaunded more ſtrictly? and yet that name or memoriall of them is rooted out, by taking away from them every honourable remembrance with this condition, therefore, it was lawfull to retaine the appurtenances of idolatrous worſhip, namely that no honour at all were imparted, or conveyed vnto the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol thereby.

This then ſeemes to be agreed betwixt vs, that appurtenances of Idols may be ſpared, ſo that all the honour of the Idol be quite deſtroyed. Now to apply, what (I pray) doth all this concerne the naturall geſtures? Can they be for the honour of an Idol in Gods owne worſhip? If this be poſſible, then either becauſe the Idol ſet them in Gods worſhip, or they are directed vnto the Idol in ſome part, or they are ſuch as are vſed in idolatrous worſhip in like manner; but the firſt is a notorious falſhood; the ſecond is impertinent to our controverſie; the third is abſurd inaſmuch as there is agreement betwixt true, and falſe worſhippers in all geſtures, and ever will be.</p>
                     <p>The third condition, on which the appurtenances of <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>17</label> Idols might remaine was if they were without certaine danger of inſnaring people to idolatry; for ſo the Lord forbade the gold and ſilver of Images, leſt they ſhould be ſnares vnto his people<hi>: Deut.</hi> 7. 25. But what is a ſnare according to the purpoſe of the law? For the beſt thing in the world, even the Sunne, Moone, and Stars,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:14577:199"/>
may become a ſnare through the corruption of man. The word [ſnare] which the law doth vſe is a metaphor taken from artificiall ſnares, which are of purpoſe made to catch ſomething. The Lord therefore condemnes thoſe idolatrous things, which were ſnares onely by their inſtitution and nature<hi>:</hi> as firſt in reſpect of their idolatrous vſe continued, before their faces, for that was an abomination and ſnare. Secondly, in reſpect of their outward forme, continued before their faces, (the things themſelues being otherwiſe without neceſſity or profit) for that was a temptation, as the gariſh ornaments of an harlot are vnto carnall vncleanneſſe. Thirdly, if you deeme that the materialls themſelues were forbidden, becauſe they might become ſnares; I anſwer, ſupoſing that, yet they were onely the materialls of ſuch appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances of the Idols, as were proper vnto it, and the ſame munerically, which adorned it. And this is cleere in the law, as will appeare vnto you, if you pleaſe to make ſearch. But what is this to bodily geſtures? As for idolatrous vſe, we onely ſpeake of geſtures as they are referred and applied wholly to Gods owne worſhip<hi>:</hi> for idolatrous and artificiall forme, geſtures haue none, but what is naturall, and of the making of God himſelf, and beſides every one of theſe is needfull and profitable, as I haue ſhewed. Laſtly for materialls of Idol-appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, geſtures haue nothing to anſwer, except you would aboliſh geſtures from all parts of Gods worſhip, as well as from any one part. And moreover, what are the geſtures of wicked idolatours to the geſtures of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people? Are not every mans geſtures his owne? In a word, enſnaring objects, (which the Lord condemned and forbade to his people) were alwayes externall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters without them it was never heard that ſtanding, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or kneeling, were called ſnares from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                     <p>Thus I haue ſhewed three neceſſary conditions, on which it was lawfull to to ſpare idolatrous appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>18</label>

perhaps ſome man will object, that Gods law was abſolute without theſe conditions, becauſe it runnes in generall termes without limitation. I anſwer. Firſt, I take it, that is not true, for it cannot be prooved, that the materialls of Idols appurtenances were to be aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: Groues indeed were to be burnt with fire. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 3. or cut downe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 13. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 5. except firſt they were to be cut downe, and then burnt with fire in vſefull occaſion; as <hi>Gideon</hi> cut downe the Groue of <hi>Baal,</hi> and then vſed the wood to a burnt ſacrifice, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 6. 26. High places were onely to be pulled downe, <hi>Numb.</hi> 33. 52. Altars onely to be broken downe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 3. Ornaments of the Idol, as gold and ſilver were onely forbidden vnto private mens liberty: See <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 25. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30. 22. though perhaps reſerved to publick vſe and devoted to the Lords treaſury, (compare <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 6. 17, 19,) and if they were to be, vtterly aboliſhed, no other <note n="b" place="margin">So the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Deut. 7. 25. ch. 1. arg. 6,</note> gold or ſilver is meant, but that whereof the perſon of the Idol or Image, (as I may ſpeake) did conſiſt, and not ſuch as was but an appurtenance to his perſon of which I onely treat in this place. Secondly, ſuppoſe that God commaunded all the idolatrous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances to be deſtroyed, yet that commaundement bound onely the Iewes in the Iudiciall ſtrictneſſe of it. I call that Iudiciall ſtrictneſſe, which requires the aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of things, meerely, becauſe they haue ſerved the Idol, though they be otherwiſe lawfull and good, and that all honour of the Idol be deſtroyed, and all danger of him vtterly taken away. Theſe points are of morall and durable conſideration, and therefore when all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and danger of the Idol is taken away, what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall wickedneſſe can be in reteining, (otherwiſe) good and lawfull things, which had beene onely dead, and paſſiue appurtenances vnto it? Now it is evident, that the ſtrictneſſe of the law concerned onely the Iewes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> (for ſo the Lord
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:14577:200"/>

Thus the Lord ſpeake<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now what is the ſtrictneſſe of the law vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe conſiderations to vs? Are not you reſolved, that the judicialls, (as we call them) of <hi>Moſes</hi> be abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, ſo farre as they ſerue not to fence the law morall? I thinke it is hard to ſee any benefit of fencing the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall law in the deſtruction of ſuch things as had beene v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to idolatry; if they be not onely otherwiſe lawfull, and good in themſelues, but alſo be ſo clenſed of all their abuſe and filthineſſe, that all both honour and danger of the Idol, or Idol-worſhip is quite taken away from them. Verily if theſe things be true, then all your places of Scriptures alledged to the proofe of your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition concerning ceremonious ſubſtances of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, are ſtill further off from the condemnation of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall geſtures.</p>

But what need I trouble my ſelfe about words? let the fifth ſection before be reviewed, and it will appeare that your quotations doe not come neere to geſtures in Gods owne worſhip: yet if any of your proofes had concerned them, theſe would haue beene they, which ſpeake of actions in falſe and idolatrous worſhip, but your owne proofes ſufficiently refute your ſelues: we muſt not (ſay your quotations) ſerue God, as the Nations ſerved their gods<hi>:</hi> yet the ſame quotations doe ſay againe, that the Nations bowed down to their gods.

                     <p>I Confeſſe in this paſſage, there is a great deale of force for you, if you can make good that which you <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>21</label> ſay. There are three things wherein the examination of this point conſiſteth. Firſt, we muſt enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kneeling at Sacrament be allowed by God in his word, or no? Secondly, we muſt make an hiſtoricall ſearch by whom kneeling was firſt put in practiſe from the time that the Sacrament was inſtituted by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt. Thirdly, becauſe you affirme that Antichriſt firſt brought kneeling into the Sacrament, we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether their kneeling be the ſame with ours now in controverſie? Truely, if kneeling was not firſt allowed by Gods word, and was not firſt put in practiſe in the Lords Sacrament by Gods owne people, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Popiſh kneeling differ not, but is of the ſame ſort with ours, I plainly yeeld, that kneeling at Sacrament is deviſed by man, But if in triall it appeare, that all theſe be contrary, then it muſt needes follow that your aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is contrary to the truth. Well, what haue you to ſay for the proofe of them in order? Firſt doth not God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low kneeling at Sacrament in his word, by ſuch rules &amp; directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as he giveth for geſtures in his worſhip, by ſuch rules &amp; directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as he giveth for geſtures in Sacraments? Behold in this point, you are altogether ſilent, but you
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:14577:201"/>
forgot your ſelues when you paſſed it over. Is that which God allowes in his word mans deviſe? or rather is it not Gods ordinance? All geſtures were mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes by your conceit in the Sacraments of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Baptiſme, becauſe God commands no one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture in particular abſolutely, nay expreſſely no one at all. All geſtures were mans deviſes in the Paſſeover a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Iewes, becauſe there was no geſture expreſly and particularly appointed: but who ſees not that this is your deviſe without reaſon: for ſince the Sacraments muſt needs be celebrated, celebrated they could not be without geſtures, which are of flat neceſſity, and great importance therein, and yet it pleaſeth the Lord to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe no geſtures in particular to be vſed in them, is it not an evident thing that liberty of geſtures is Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, I ſay, his ordinance, for he appointed that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of purpoſe, and not forgetting (as man doth many things in making of lawes) to make mention of them. What did you meane therefore to preſume the geſture of kneeling at Sacrament to be mans deviſe without the triall of the word, which onely can determine in this caſe; eſpecially when your ſelues ſpeake other where in this manner: <hi>If kneeling came from better men then the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, yet that is nothing materiall, except it be prooved law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full out of holy writ, which onely can declare the good way, yea though it came from them, which were next and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſucceſſours to the Apoſtles.</hi> Demand. p. 66, 67. <hi>It is a groſſe and Popiſh courſe in queſtions of Religion, to ground, and inferre vpon the auncient vſe of a thing, the lawfulneſſe of it,</hi> Diſp. pag. 139. <hi>We muſt not looke at antiquity, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the word of God, which is moſt auncient,</hi> Park. of the Croſſe, l. 2. p. 124. <hi>Kneeling at Sacrament is allowed if it be warranted by Gods word, as kneeling is allowed in prayer,</hi> Diſp. pag. 100. <hi>That which God hath by his word purified for his worſhip ought not to be accounted vncleane,</hi> Demaund. p. 20. Thus you ſhould haue gone about to prooue kneeling mans deviſe by the rule of Gods word, and not

as you doe by the vſe, or practiſe thereof alone, which your ſelues determine cannot ſerue the turne. Your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſiderations without the word cannot be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to prooue that you deſire; for Gods holy ordinance may ſometimes <note n="*" place="margin">Diſp. reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth thus, pag. 104. <hi>Kneeling bad no vſe before Antichriſts time, therefore could haue no good vſe</hi> Sir, I deny your argument.</note> be firſt put in practiſe by wicked Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latours, as ſingle aſ perſion in Baptiſme <note n="c" place="margin">There is no mention of the publick practiſe of ſprinkling till about 1300 yeeres <hi>a Chriſto nato:</hi> which was when (as you ſay) Antichriſt was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his full height.</note> was, before the Church of Chriſt did receiue it; therefore you are ſhort of neceſſary proofe already, whatſoever become of the other conſiderations which follow.

For ſooth the <hi>Abridgement</hi> brings not forth one proofe, but giues vs bare affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the thing was ſo. Alas I that wiſe men ſhould be ſo much overſeene! Did they not thinke, that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the practiſe of a famous Church, and ſo many learned men, (then whom no age hath knowne more, or more learned) the matter did require ſome manner of proofe?

Beſides an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded hypotheſis, all this is no more but conjectural; for the Diſputer can conclude nothing convincingly, whether they reteined the geſture of Chriſt, (whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was) or changed, whether they varied from the Loue-feaſts, and Idol feaſts, or no, he and I can deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine nothing; becauſe it is left vndetermined by the holy writings. Yea they might kneele in thoſe times, for ought he can diſprooue, and therefore this poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity makes all his other conjectures weaker, and weaker, Secondly, (ſaith <note n="k" place="margin">Pag 74.</note> he) <hi>In the firſt part of the ſecond age of the Church can it be doubted, but ſuch worthy Fathers and Churches as then lived would follow the ſteps of the worthies of the former age? Can it be thought that they would bring ſo ſoone a geſture in vſe, which might not be vſed, but with violating Gods law?</hi> Can it be doubted, but you are an egregious trifler, that goe about firſt to proove, they did not kneele, becauſe their predeceſſours had not kneeled: and then they did not doe ſuch a thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ought not (as you ſurmiſe) to doe it. Are you not aſhamed of all this childiſh froth? You beg that their predeceſſours kneeled not, and that they would not vary in their geſture from them, becauſe kneeling was not a table-geſture. It ſeemes you need no bookes to gather the hiſtory of times, you can gather it by reaſon from duty to practiſe: and ſo much to this idle trifling. But what may be ſaid to the latter part of the ſecond age of the Church? <hi>Why,</hi> (ſaith <note n="l" place="margin">Pag. 77.</note> he) <hi>if kneeling were vſed in the latter end of this age, then there were three ſeverall geſtures uſed in the ſame age: but there were not three ſeverall geſtures vſed in the ſame age.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:14577:203"/>
The ſequel of the Maior is falſe; for ſitting can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be prooved in the ſecond age of the Church: but what if ſitting and ſtanding were vſed both, what doth that hinder but kneeling might be vſed alſo; As if in this preſent age, there be not ſtanding, ſitting, and kneeling vſed, yea in the ſame Church at the ſame time. Thirdly, next he goes about to prooue, that no geſture was vſed in the Church, from the middle of the ſecond age, to each ſucceeding age before the yeere 1220 but ſtanding onely, and ſo he comprehends aboue ten ages together, let vs ſee therefore what he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith <note n="m" place="margin">Pag. 78.</note> he) <hi>kneeling had beene vſed all this while, in all likelihood ſome mention would haue beene made of it in the Church-writings.</hi> Anſw. Firſt, it is commended vnto vs in the Church-writings, as in due place I will will make appeare. Secondly, if it were not, you cannot reaſon <hi>a non ſcripto ad non factum,</hi> ſpecially in mutuall geſtures; nay you cannot reaſon negatiuely in a matter of fact from the ſtory of Scripture it ſelfe; if you could, you might prooue the <hi>Iewes</hi> vſed no geſture at all in their Circumciſion, and Paſſeover; for none is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto poſterity. But what ſhould I follow you in your dallying? Your ſelfe confeſſe that this reaſon is no more then a probability, and ſo kneeling might be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Church notwithſtanding. Againe he giues vs another reaſon, (pag. 83. &amp;c.) which (as farre as I can ſee, for I confeſſe his proceeding and method is very confuſed) he afterwards brancheth into three argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or conſiderations. <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. (ſaith <note n="n" place="margin">Pag. 93.</note> he) <hi>Standing was the geſture allowed, and vſed by the Church in all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick prayers on every Sabbath throughout the yeere, and ſo at the conſecration of holy myſteries, from Anno</hi> 150. <hi>till Anno</hi> 1220. <hi>therefore it was their geſture allowed at the receiving of them.</hi> Anſwer. Your conſequence is vnſound, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as one geſture may be vſed at conſecration of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and another at the receiving of them. You ſee the example of ſo much at this day, and though it ſeeme
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:14577:203"/>
ſome what harſh in your eare, that they ſhould ſtand at praying, and kneele downe at receiving, yet if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thoſe times well, you ſhall finde that Chriſtians did thinke it highly needfull to worſhip, or adore at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and you muſt not enquire what was fitteſt to be done, but what they did or might poſſibly do, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the ſtreame of their devotions and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments did then carry them. Sure I am they allowed and vſed many things more vnreaſonable, and improbable, then to kneele at the Sacrament, and ſtand at their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers and bleſſings. But what if your concluſion be yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, what harme will follow? I graunt that ſtanding was allowed in the act of receiving, I deny, that knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was diſallowed; for as for the cuſtome of ſtanding in ſome Churches vpon the Sabbaths at prayer, you know it was not, becauſe kneeling might not be vſed at prayer, but ſtanding was vſed onely in reſpect of the Sabbaoths, ſo that neither was kneeling condemned in it ſelfe on the Sabbaoths, nor at all condemned vpon the weeke dayes<hi>:</hi> yea, and vpon the Sabbaoths, that ſtanding at the Altar, which is ſpoken, is meant of the Miniſters rather then of the people, and the proofes which you bring ſpeaking of ſtanding at the Altar will avow no more. Nay laſtly, your owne teſtimonies doe condemne you, many of which doe confeſſe, that ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was in many Churches laid downe, and not vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally received in all places and times, neither may you ſay that the publick order and cuſtome was for the moſt part otherwiſe, for perhaps the better ſort ſtroue againſt that bond of ſtanding, as you doe now againſt kneeling in this Church, and therein I doubt not but you would haue taken their parts, if with theſe reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons you had bin then a liueſman among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Mark now this argument of yours. It ſhewes not, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemned kneeling on the Sabbaoth, as being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutable to the Sacrament, or prayer, but as they thought vnſutable to that day. It ſhewes not, they condemned
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:14577:204"/>
kneeling at Sacrament any weeke dayes at all excepting the dayes of Pentecoſt. It ſhewes not that the people ſtood, but the Miniſters onely at the Altar. In a word it ſhewes not, that the cuſtome of ſtanding was accepted without exception, but rather that it found from age to age, great, (and me thinks in your eſteeme alſo commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table) reſiſtance. Arg. 3. <note n="o" place="margin">Pag 97.</note> is in effect the ſelf ſame with this and therefore I need to giue it no other anſwer. Arg. 2. He reaſoneth in <note n="p" place="margin">Pag 94.</note> this manner. <hi>If when</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius <hi>made his decree for adoring the Sacrament, knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling were not in vſe, then in all probability kneeling at the Communion was not received into practiſe, in any age prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the dayes of</hi> Honorius: <hi>But when</hi> Honorius <hi>made his decree for adoring the Sacrament, kneeling was not in vſe.</hi> Anſwer. The Aſſumption here is not current, for knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling might be uſed in the time of <hi>Honorius,</hi> notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his decree which might ſuppoſe it, and by the act of bowing divert, and direct it for a new adoring of the viſible myſteries. So <hi>Honorius</hi> might mention bowing onely, becauſe the ſame ſhould plainly diſtinguiſh, and ſignifie adoration to be directed vnto the bread, and likewiſe increaſe the degree thereof; and he that obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth ſhall ſee, that both the cleereſt evidence, and the higheſt degree &amp; perfection of idolatrous groſſneſſe in the Popiſh geſtures in their Sacrament at this day, is the ſenſible and expreſſe mooving or bowing of the body to the Wafer-cake made an Idol.

new Idol of bread. (for if kneelers muſt bow to the bread, kneeling alſo would be carried to the bread vnder and with bowing, which demonſtrates the object worſhipped, as if one ſhould point at it with the finger) and partly alſo adds vnto the degree of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration, for who will not eaſily thinke that the higheſt degree, and not the leaſt and loweſt was intended by the will of <hi>Honorius.</hi> And indeed when elſe was knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling added to the Romiſh Bread-worſhip? Strange it were that none of the Hiſtorians, or Schoolemen, or Canoniſts mentioned how it came in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by what authority through all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, if it came into practiſe ſo lately<hi>:</hi> neither finde we that any Popes or Councels made any decree ſince <hi>Honorius</hi> to bring it into the Church<hi>:</hi> behold then how your Aſſumption is ſick to death, except you can cure it by ſome infallible teſtimonies. But for your Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that certainly is but a ſimple patch of your learning. If kneeling ſay you was not in vſe, when <hi>Honorius</hi> made his decree, then in all probability it was not in vſe in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny age proceding the dayes of <hi>Honorius:</hi> a pretty ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, if kneeling was not in vſe in <hi>Honorius</hi> time, then it was not in vſe aboue a thouſand yeeres before.

Thus you make all your three argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to hang vpon one medium, and I haue given an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer before.

Shall we thinke, but you wanted a little depth? And why (I pray) ſhould kneeling rather be in the corrupteſt times then the pureſt?

of the Church: belike you thought your words would leaue an impreſſion with men, which could not abide kneeling already, but it was not wiſely diſputed with your adverſary, (Sir) who thinkes of kneeling as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable thoughts, as you doe of ſtanding. But now the Reader hath ſeene the ſubſtance of all, which is ſaid tending to prooue, that the geſture of kneeling at the Sacrament was firſt brought in by Antichriſt. Here I muſt giue the Reader to take notice of a matter or two. Firſt I haue of purpoſe ſuppreſſed the mention of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall teſtimonies in this place, (which I haue reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the laſt chapter if God permit) and onely anſwer vnto the force of ſuch reaſons, as the Diſputer produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth. Againe in all this ſweating Diſputer, you ſhall not finde one teſtimony, which is expreſſe for ſitting in all this length of a thouſand two hundred yeares, and more. Hereunto let be added, that if the auncient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of ſtanding at prayers drew ſtanding at Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon the Sabbaoths with it, in ſome ages or pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet that ſtanding was not vſed becauſe of Chriſts example, or that it was a Table-geſture, but as the Supper had a reaſon common with it to prayer, and ſo the Auncients ſetting theſe together in one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture haue given us example to ſet them together in another.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if you will ſhew our kneeling to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>23</label> by Antichriſt, then you muſt prooue that his kneeling and ours bee of the ſame nature. This it ſeemes you made no queſtion of, or elſe you were to blame to paſſe it over in ſilence: but I will helpe you to conſider the difference. Firſt, Antichriſts kneeling is directed vnto the bread, and ſo is an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous kneeling. This application of kneeling I graunt was firſt deviſed by that man of ſinne, and grew firſt from the perſuaſion of the reall preſence, yea and the ſpeciall point of time of the Popiſh kneeling, is
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:14577:205"/>
when <note n="r" place="margin">
                           <hi>Honorius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree was of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing at eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the hoſt and that was of bowing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hoſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, as the applying of kn. at the inſtant of elevation, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the doctrine and received pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church thereupon doth evidently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Oh but then (ſayes the Replier) you confeſſe that bowing of the body before the bread lifted vp is to adore it. Repl. partic. ch. 3. ſect. 21. Alas good man! we expound the decreevndoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of reall preſence in the time of <hi>Honori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> generall practiſe of Bread-worſhip thereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the act of elevation. I warrant you (Sir) there is no danger of concluding therefore that all bowing before the elements is adoring of them, you haue not outſhot your adverſary then, but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runne good reaſon, and plaine dealing.</note> the conſecrated hoſt is lifted vp, and it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the rule in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for the people to worſhip any thing, that is not higher then themſelues. What is this kneeling now vnto ours I pray, whereof the queſtion is of the act of receiving, and not elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? We worſhip onely the living God, and deteſt that abominable bread-worſhip perhaps as much as you doe. Can you make kneeling to God, and kneeling to an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol to be of like nature? This you cannot deny, that geſtures and actions are principally diſtinguiſhed by their objects and ends. Papiſts and we doe agree in the vſe of all geſtures of worſhip; but they apply the ſame to idolatrous vſe, and we apply them to the ſervice of the Lord in his owne worſhip. Wherefore there is as much difference betwixt our kneeling at Sacrament, and the Papiſts kneeling to their Breaden God, as is betwixt our kneeling in prayer, and their kneeling vnto Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. I would faine learne, how any people can be more contrary to Idolaters, or more juſt then to giue vnto God that which is Gods, when they had given it vnto the Divell. Loe here is a difference betwixt their kneeling and ours, wider then the heaven is from earth. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let me preſſe you with your opinion of the Papiſts Sacrament of the Altar, for I am perſuaded you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved it is no Sacrament of Ieſus Chriſt, why will you object vnto vs kneeling thereat, more then the knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of any other Idolaters in falſe worſhip? Haue wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Pagans abuſed kneeling a thouſand wayes? Thoſe we paſſe, and kneele vnto God notwithſtanding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt; and why ſhould this idolatrous kneeling of the Papiſts be more vnto vs then all they? Shew vs if you can out of Gods word, that this kneeling is liker out kneeling then the kneeling of all other Idolaters? For if their Sacrament be no Sacrament, <hi>if their Breaden God</hi>
                        <pb n="388" facs="tcp:14577:206"/>
                        <hi>be an Idol to them,</hi> if their adoration be the worſt idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try that the world hath heard of, why ſhould their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination come nearer to our kneeling at the Lords table then the like committed by the brutiſh Pagans? Thirdly, our geſture which we vſe is our owne, and the Papiſts never had the commaund thereof. <hi>To the pure,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>all things are pure;</hi> we kneele not out of ſubjection to the will of Antichriſt, but out of the allowance of Gods word: nay our kneeling at Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto God alone is a confeſſion againſt Antichriſt and his idolatry. Fourthly, if our kneeling at Sacrament be the ſame of nature with the Popiſh, then is your ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſtanding, of the ſame nature with their ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſtanding. Behold the Pope himſelfe ſits at Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; the Prieſts doe ſtand at Sacrament, (and theſe are the principall Idolaters in the Bread worſhip) and therefore ſitting and ſtanding be in the ſame caſe with kneeling. Perhaps you will ſay, <hi>Kneeling was deviſed by the Papists, ſitting and ſtanding were not.</hi> Anſwer. So farre as he deviſed kneeling, (that is to worſhip an Idol) ſo farre he deviſed ſitting, and ſtanding; but as ſitting or ſtanding were or might be vſed in the Sacrament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Breaden God was borne, lawfully, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods owne order; ſo kneeling was and might be ſo vſed alſo. Then the Papiſts at length, when Bread-worſhip came vp abuſed them altogether: and ſo how are they not every one of them in the ſame caſe? Thus I haue examined the firſt branch of your Aſſumption, and I doe not doubt but the Chriſtian Reader will think all that you ſay too weake to prooue our kneeling at Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to be mans deviſe. Nay notwithſtanding all that you ſay, the ſame may be Gods ordinance, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the auncient Church, and quite of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> kneeling in their Breaden Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Now I paſſe to the ſecond branch of your Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that kneeling is notoriouſly knowne to haue been of old and ſtill to be abuſed to Idolatry by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</p>

                     <p>THis part of your Aſſumption carries three errours <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>24</label> in it which I will remember you of, the one, that the kneeling of the Papiſts is kneeling at the Lords Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament ſuch as ours is; then that our kneeling, (as if every mans geſtures were not his owne) hath beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed to Idolatry by them; and laſtly, (which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more) that our kneeling is a conformity to them, and a monument of their idolatry, and this laſt you dare <note n="s" place="margin">

Well thus you ſay, but how can you make it good? Truly I finde nothing materiall in any of your bookes, except I ſhould referre hither all thoſe ſcattered ſayings of yours, whereby you linke vs with, and condemne vs by the idolatrous Papiſts.</p>
                     <p>Firſt you ſay, <note n="t" place="margin">Abridg. p. 62. Diſp. pag. 108.</note> 
                        <hi>at the ſame time in the ſame action, we vſe the ſame outward geſture that the Papiſts doe.</hi> Anſwer. Our action is not the ſame. But what if all be true, which you ſay, your ſelues doe as much in all geſtures as the Papiſts doe throughout all divine ordinances. You kneele, and they kneele; you ſtand, and they ſtand; you ſit, and they ſit. So you agree likewiſe with the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of <hi>Baal,</hi> and all idolatrous <hi>Gentiles</hi> in ſtanding, ſitting, and kneeling: know ye not that the publick doctrine and worſhip, which any people imbraceth or profeſſeth, diſtinguiſheth publick geſtures? Thus it is in all religions, thus it is in the true. Secondly, you <note n="u" place="margin">
                           <hi>Bradſh. arg.</hi> 2.</note> ſay, <hi>It is an honour to Antichriſt to leaue the practiſe of</hi>

                        <hi>Reformed Churches and follow him.</hi> Anſwer. Reformed Churches are divers in outward orders, and geſtures, and there is liberty ſo to be; reformation conſiſting not in leaving any geſtures of Gods worſhip, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring them to his glory, as they ought to be, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating the abuſes from them. Now is it no honour to Antichriſt to vſe the geſture which he vſeth, wherein reformation ſtands not; for all geſtures are common to all falſe, and idolatrous worſhip with the true worſhip of God: neither haue thoſe Churches, who haue caſt off the yoke of Antichriſt made a reformation in the geſture of the Sacrament by taking kneeling away, but by taking abuſes of kneeling away. As for kneeling it ſelfe, it is certaine they tooke that away onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue ſcandall and danger in the firſt change, when they ſaw needfull to ſettle ſome one geſture among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Furthermore, I muſt tell Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> that his ſpeech ſuppoſeth a grievous falſhood, namely that we choſe to kneele of purpoſe to ſide with Antichriſt, and to differ from the reformed Churches, when there was as it were a competition, which of them ſhould haue our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: for it is manifeſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ough we did not refuſe ſtanding, or ſitting, becauſe other Churches vſed the ſame, nor againe did we kneele, becauſe we honoured the Romiſh abon ination; but vpon other reaſons looking vpon neither of both. You would make the world belieue, that in ſetting before vs theſe two divers parternes, we ſtroue rather to be conformable to the Romiſh; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to bleſſed King <hi>Edward</hi> 6. with many Martyrs, and worthies of his time, beſides the ſtate in the beginning of bleſſed Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Raigne, (not to ſpeake of more) you doe manifeſt wrong, who ſtudied to provide, and appoint what geſture they could judge the fitteſt in their times, as became ſo wiſe governours; having their eye rather vpon the ſtate of their Citizens, and dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, then beyond Seas either vpon <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Geneva:</hi> and howſoever, the conformity now of ſingular perſons

Survey p. 73. 80.</note> ſay, <hi>It is notoriouſly knowne, that this geſture of knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was borrowed from them, and was enioyned for their ſakes in King</hi> Edwards <hi>time.</hi> Anſwer. That it was not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued from them is evident by this that there was in the beginning of King <hi>Edwards</hi> Raigne a certaine ſpace graunted of liberty; and truly herein was the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God declared, that the kneeling of former daies was not continued but intermitted for a time; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther borrowing of kneeling to God in this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could be none, for they had none ſuch to lend vs. Againe where you ſay, that kneeling was brought into this Church for their ſakes, it is true no otherwiſe but according to the Apoſtles practiſe, who became all things to all men, (Iewes, Pagan Idolatours, and the weake) that he might, (if it were poſſible) perſuade and ſaue them, but by no meanes for any honourable reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to their Bread-worſhip, againſt which ſome of the firſt enjoyners of kneeling confeſſed in the flames of devouring fire. Alſo to this objection I haue anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more largely otherwhere.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, you ſay, <hi>Kneeling is a note of Antichriſt.</hi> Anſwer. As waſhing was a note of the Iewiſh Church to diſtinguiſh it from Chriſt and his Apoſtles. It were wonderfull ſtrange if the true Church could be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the falſe by bodily geſtures, which are common vnto both. Verily if our kneeling to God be a note of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I will begin a new Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme. Indeed kneeling to the bread-made-god is a note of a Papiſt, and the bread-made-god is a note of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, and kneeling to God alone in his owne ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is a note of a true worſhipper, but kneeling ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply is a note of neither one nor other.

Firſt, that what you ſay againſt kneeling at Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament may as well be ſaid againſt ſtanding or ſitting, which may be alſo ſpared in the Church of God. It were ridiculous here to ſay that ſitting or ſtanding are lawfull by Gods word, and ſo is not kneeling; for beſides that it is a begged falſhood, it is an vtter relinquiſhing of the preſent purpoſe, which onely concerneth the neceſſary vſe of geſtures, and behold you cannot deny, but ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding may be ſpared, ſitting may be ſpared, and for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in that ſenſe I will not deny but kneeling may be ſpared alſo.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, kneeling at Sacrament is neceſſary as much as our Churches, Bells, Ropes, Ringing, Fontes, Seates, Pulpits, Tables, Table-cloths, Chalices, &amp;c. which you doe <note n="k" place="margin">Demaund. p. 28, 29.</note> allow notwithſtanding they haue beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed vnto idolatry, yet theſe are not abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: for if ſuch or ſuch Churches were b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aten downe, as haue beene abuſed to idolatry, (as the Chriſtians here in <hi>England</hi> at their converſion ſerved the heatheniſh Temples. Mr. <hi>Fox Martyrol. pag.</hi> 96.) and others built in their ſtead, the Church I warrant you would not
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:14577:210"/>
want the ſame; but you allow theſe things, becauſe partly they be abſolutely neceſſary in their kinde, and partly the particular things themſelues be reſpectiuely neceſſary, namely, orderly, comely, and commodious to Gods worſhip. Thus kneeling is neceſſary inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as geſture is neceſſary in it its kind: yea even knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is a geſture that is orderly, comely, &amp; commodious in the Lords Supper, (which I haue made plaine in this Treatiſe already where your contrary reaſoning gaue me occaſion.) Thirdly, as kneeling in reſpect of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath a neceſſary vſe in the Sacrament, ſo it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſingular perſons in this Church by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of ſuperiours. Is it neceſſary to preſerue the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of your Miniſteries? Then kneeling at Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is neceſſary, for reſiſtance whereof the ſaid liberty is reſtreined vnto you. Againe is it neceſſary to receiue the Sacrament, and feed vpon the body and blood of our Lord Ieſus? then kneeling is neceſſary, without which that Communion with the Church is denied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you. You grant meates ſacrificed vnto idols might be eaten, becauſe they ſerved for the private vſe of mans life, <hi>(Demaunds. pag.</hi> 20.) And ſhall not the food of our ſoules be broken, (in the miniſtery of the word) and received, (in the Lords Supper) when the ſame hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beene ſacrificed to idols; but onely the naturall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, (which ſerues for private vſe of mans life, and publick vſe of Gods worſhip both) hath beene (as it were) ſacrificed to idols, and yet not the ſelfe ſame nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericall geſture (as the Idols things were the ſelfe ſame) neither. So that if kneeling may be ſpared in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, yet foraſmuch as Popiſh pollution is but acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall vnto it, and that it is no ſinne formally, as blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, witchcraft, lying, &amp;c. behold as the caſe ſtands (brethren) it cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thirdly, all the Scriptures which you quote condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nne onely that offence of another in things indifferent, which is made by him, who is at liberty, and not bound. They ſpeake not of the caſe (of our Church) of vſing, or refuſing thoſe things, as men are tyed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of authority, but as they are free in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to doe what they will. This you cannot but ſee. We muſt not pleaſe our ſelues ſaith the Apoſtle, but our neighbours for their edification. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 1, 2. But what is this I pray to thoſe things which are done, not for pleaſing of our ſelues, but to obey the Magiſtrate by Gods owne appointment? I will giue you two equall conſiderations, to make this more evident<hi>:</hi> firſt, except authority ought to be obeyed in things indifferent not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that ſome take offence thereat ſometimes, cannot poſſibly ſtand. There is no action publikely done, but ſome among many will be ſure to miſtake,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:14577:214"/>
and ſtumble at it. Muſt not a ſervant or child doe a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe (though otherwiſe indifferent) at the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of Maſter or Father, if others will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then not onely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man that will pretend ſcruple may deny obedience, but alſo all others muſt decline obedience for ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the diſobedient.

                        </gap>e is greater, then in all other ſocieties. Is it poſſible to eſtabliſh a Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome conſtitutions, &amp; orders of things indifferent? Is it probable, among infinite millions of that people, of divers humors, &amp; diſpoſitions, none ſhould be offended at ſuch conſtitutions, &amp; orders? Shall an wholeſome Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical law be alwaies revoked vpon information, &amp; complaint that ſome be ſcandalized? Then belike for times, places, geſtures, &amp;c. of Gods publick worſhp, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man muſt be left at his owne liberty, and this will bring the Church to a ſpeedy confuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without remedy.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, obedience to the Magiſtrate in a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different is a greater duet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I conſider, that the commandement is juſt and lawfull in its owne nature, and what? Shall I then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe obedience to that which is lawfull, for ſurmiſes (of certaine men) which are vnrighteous, and vnlawfull? Shall the beauty (which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Fifthly, the weake who are offended at a thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent commanded by the Magiſtrates authority are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in bound to obey the Magiſtrate alſo themſelues.

                        </gap>ll I be bound rather to doe, as he doth, (who ought not to doe ſo) then to doe that, which both of vs, ought to doe for conſcience toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? What conſcience is there in this? Sure if taking offence ſet a man at liberty, and acquitted him from the ſinne of diſobedience, <hi>(a toto)</hi> then it were more likely a great deale; but now that that the weake himſelfe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth againſt God, by being offended againſt a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full command of the Magiſtrate, there is ſmall reaſon, that I ſhould make my ſelfe a voluntary partaker.

<pb n="404" facs="tcp:14577:215"/>
and laſtly, the effect of ſcandall of private perſons in a thing indifferent is nothing ſo great, as the effect of diſobedience to the law and Magiſtrate, as experience of all times declareth. And all theſe conſiderations doe plainly ſhew that obedience to the Magiſtrate in a thing indifferent is a greater duty, then the contenting of a private perſon; eſpecially, if it be added, that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrate vnderſtanding himſelfe, doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſe things to be done, but provide that the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe thereof be ſhewed, that ſo convenient me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But ſet aſide the meaning of this text, muſt we not abſteine from appearance of evill in ſome caſe? Truely I grant, when there is a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in profeſſed evill, ſay idolatry. As if the three noble

Againe, I grant, when there is an vnſeaſonable practiſe againſt the ſeemelineſſe or ſutableneſſe of publick places or buſineſſee; as if in market places, or publick meetings, or civill occaſions, a man ſhould fall on his knees and pray: but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde this outward worſhipping is contrary to the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the word, which appoints every thing to be done in due ſeaſon. But what is all this to kneeling at Sacrament; for neither is there idolatry profeſſed in, (but exploded from) our Sacrament by Gods great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, neither is perſonall worſhip vnſeaſonable to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall worſhip, as other where I haue plenteouſly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if a thing indifferent haue a ſhew of evill, it makes it not vnlawfull to him who hath a calling to doe it; Brethren, let every man wherin he is called, therin abide with God. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 24. we are called to kneel at Sacrament being children, and ſervants of the Church and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, we muſt obey: he that is called in the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſervant, is a freeman of the Lord Ieſus, verſe 22. Thirdly, we muſt not refuſe any geſture, becauſe it hath a ſhew of evill, except we can vſe another without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch a ſhew: for in ſo doing, whiles we ſhall eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew the rocks, we fall vpon the ſands. Now I aske you in reſpect of whom is kneeling like to be a ſhew of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry? You <note n="c" place="margin">Diſp. pag. 201</note> ſay, we ſeeme to commit idolatry to the ſimple at leaſt: and I ſay, to the ſame ſimple, your ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and ſitting are like alſo to be a ſhew of profaneſſe<hi>:</hi> yea more your refuſing to kneele is a ſhew of atrogancy, and pride; and in this Church of faction, and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Nay yet more, when you will loſe your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries and the Communion it ſelfe rather then kneele, you make ſhew of vile hypocriſie, that will part with the greateſt good things in the world, for avoiding of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, ſuch in miſconſtruction, and outward appearance to ſome people onely. And yet inconcluſion I adde, that as farre as I can perceiue, kneeling at Sacrament hath not ſo much as appearance of idolatry, whatſoever you ſay to the contrary. For to paſſe, that ſimple people,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:14577:220"/>
(ſuch as you ſpeake of) doe not lightly ſuſpect vs to worſhip the bread as the Papiſts doe, whoſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they never ſaw or vnderſtood, this is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improbable, that any ſhould ſuſpect vs to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the bread and wine, when wee receiue them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our mouthes, and be eating, and drinking of them, for thereof is our controverſie at this time. But here I cannot paſſe one vnkinde ſpeech of the Abridgement. <hi>It is</hi> (ſaith <note n="d" place="margin">Abridg. p. 66.</note> it) <hi>a farre leſse ſinne, and not ſo groſſe an appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of idolatry to binde vs to kneele before a Crucifixe, then to binde vs, as it is with vs, to kneeele before the bread and wine.</hi> Anſwer, For the conſideration of tying and bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I haue ſatisfied in another place: to the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon you make hither pertinent, I ſay it is incredible that kneeling before an Image, (that is you meane to it ſome way, for elſe we innocently kneele before the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages and Crucifixes in our glaſſe windowes) which is an expreſſed idolatry forbidden in the word, is a leſſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of idolatry, then kneeling before the bread and wine according to the Lords owne ordinance. I will not deny the worſhip of the Breaden God to be a worſe idolatry, then the worſhipping of a Crucifixe, but you miſtake of your aime a mile, when you would make that which is an appearance of idolatry, which it therefore appearance becauſe it is expreſſedly ſuch, a leſſe appearance, then that which is appearance onely, and is not at all ſuch. Beſides if you ſaid truly, yet you ſhould haue conſidered, that the beſt action may haue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an appearance of being worſe then that which is bad. For it is plaine, that looke what ſinne is adjudged and ſuſpected of any excellent action, (as a great ſinne may be adjudged, and ſuſpected) the appearance of that ſinne muſt needs be worſe, (whiles you ſpeake of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but meere appearance) then the appearance of any reall ſinne, which is not ſo great as it, though it be a great one. Therefore as my firſt anſwer is ſufficient to ſhew this ſpeech of yours to be falſe, if you compare
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:14577:220"/>
meere appearance of idolatry with the appearance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all idolatry: ſo this latter ſhewes it out of doubt to be moſt reproachfull, if you compare meere appearances, (I ſay meere ones) together. And ſo much to ſhew that kneeling at Sacrament is no appearance of idolatry, at leaſt, that it is not ſuch appearance, as in reſpect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is not lawfull for vs to vſe it in this Church.</p>

Is there the ſame reaſon betwixt Idolatours who are giuen vp, doing that (in worſhipping Images at all) which the Lord abhorres of all other ſinnes: And Gods owne people, who come vnto himſelfe alone, and that in his owne holy ordinance?

Fourthly, you <note n="m" place="margin">Abridg. as before. Hither I may referre thoſe two Scip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures quoted by the Abridg. p. 62. namely Exod. 21. 33, 34.

If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fall into Idolatry by our kneelling, it is not becauſe kneelling is a pitt, but their hearts are a deepe pitt of errour and deceite: It is no logge, but they like mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholik perſons, carry the block in their owne idle imagination. Yet therefore becauſe there is danger in it by the corruption of mens hearts, as there is in all things we can doe; giue vs leaue to tell men, that we kneele only to the God of heaven, as we would haue them to knowe the doctrine of our Church, that there is but one God, one Faith, and one Baptiſme. Thus therefore the doctrine, and preaching of our Church acquits vs from being guilty, by kneelling, of giuing others occaſion of Idolatry. Secondly, we haue an honeſt calling to kneele, the commandement of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and that alſo acquits vs. Thirdly, ſitting, and ſtanding are as much occaſion of vnreverence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſſe; as kneelling is of ſuperſtition, refuſing to kneele is an occaſion of trouble in the Church, heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burning, and diſſentions amongſt brethren, loſſe of your Minniſteries, and of the libertie of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Sacraments are (in reaſon) likely to haue an equality in the due (if any ſuch were) of worſhipping, and in Baptiſme the Baptized might worſhip with vs perhaps, if he were not a little infant. In the hearing of the word, all men, (even the ſimpleſt) do eaſily allow, an indulgence for ſitting, or ſtanding, when they are vpon conſideration to try the ſpirits, and diſcerne the truth, and ſo they ſee the exerciſe of the word is not in ſo ſpeciall manner an exerciſe of deuotion as praier, ſinging of pſalmes, and the Sacraments. Beſides by your reaſoning, your ſitting bare is aſmuch an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Idolatry, which is not vſed in the exerciſe of the word preached.

vs back to popery. In the whole Church thankes be to God there is no ſuch matter, and for the errours of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler perſons, that they are fallen into them, becauſe they kneele at Sacrament is a thing which we all know you can never make good: rather the want of loue to the truth, the want of the feare of God, ſelfe-opinion, and truſting to mens owne learning, the baſe depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of mens opinions vpon humours and times, the ſpirit of contradiction, and enuy, which will ever make a part againſt their judgments, whoſe perſons, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe it cannot indure: and laſty, the providence of God for mens exerciſe, that the faithfull may be tryed and manifeſted, and the vnfound left to the puniſhment of their vnfaithfullnes.

It is vndoubtedly, but your conceit, that the papiſts are ſcandalized it this manner. I will not deny but they may (according to their manner) make a great noiſe about a colour for diſgracing our cauſe, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing their owne<hi>:</hi> but that they are indeed more confirmed in their Idolatry, vpon privat conſideration, and judgment of our practiſe, you can neuer make vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue. All men do know, that they are wonte to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph againſt vs in manifould changes of our owne pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, not becauſe they are more hardned in their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereby, but becauſe being already hardened they ſecke, and make occaſions to themſelues of our reproach and diſcredit. For how can you reaſonably thinke, that they will be more hardened in their owne religion by our agreement with them in a matter of geſture (which is common to all religions) when they know we haue diſclaimed their doctrine, (doctrine being it, which in all religions determines the vſe and end of all geſtures.) Beſides, thinke you, that the papiſts eſteeme of vs ſo much, and of our judgment, and practiſe, that they will better like, and more firmely ſticke vnto their judgment, and practiſe, becauſe in any meaſure they gaine ſome countenance from our. Churches? nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſtriue as much, as poſſibly they can (as it were by an <hi>Antiperiſtaſis)</hi> to like, and ſticke vnto that which is moſt contrary.

Will they be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in their religion, becauſe we partake with them in ſome things, when the leaſt thing (which concernes the profeſſion of our religion) is eſchewed, and very preciſely eſchewed by them, therefore, becauſe we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it. I but this is an incouragement vnto them, that we haue borrowed the practiſe of our kneeling from them. I anſwer, (paſſing that he haue not bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed it as I haue ſhewed otherwhere) there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement thereby giuen, which makes them, but what followes, after they are already hardened. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the inſulting and boaſting which they vſe, is rather in pretence, then in good earneſt: for who of them can be ſo vtterly ignorant, as in his conſcience to think his owne to be the true Church, becauſe we agree with it in a naturall geſture in divine worſhip, when we agree with all religions in all geſtures; or our Church to be falſe, becaue we vſe the ſame geſture with theirs, which they are reſolued is the true; or becauſe we kneel in the act of receiving, therefore it is a juſtifiable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the bread is tranſubſtantiated, or that there is hope Popery will get in againe, becauſe kneeling (which is in all religions, as it is aplied) is alſo vſed with vs, as with the Papiſts in the bare outward geſture, when they know we do not only not apply it as they doe, but a quite contrary way. They cannot but ſee, that they might as well hope for popery to returne, by our ſitting bare in the Sacrament, by the continued vſe of our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, yea, by our kneeling in praier, ſtanding at Creed, and ſuch like, which are things of common vſe; as hope for the returne of popery from our agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with them in the geſture of the Sacrament.

                        </gap>, which is made with none of their ſtinking carryon, but is wholeſome, and good by ſtrength, and vertue of the true religion? I adde, that our kneeling is ſo farre from confirming Papiſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, that they are rather perſuaded to come vnto vs, knowing that we handle the holy Sacrament ſo r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently. But take it for granted that kneeling at Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſcandalous to the Papiſts: what then? Firſt; we are not bound in ordering of Gods worſhip to be guided by them, but rather we muſt lightly account of alienating ſuch perſons as they are by the example of our Saviour Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Secondly, what knowledge haue we, that they will be offended at our kneeling? I ſpeake of ſingular Communicants; Shall ſuch abſteine for the offence of the Papiſts, which never was nor will be taken at them in particular, but onely at the Church in generall, the cuſtome whereof is not in their power to change! What for ſuch offence as is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaſed nor leſſened, nor made more or leſſe by them, nay whoſe kneeling is not ſo much as once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of? This learning ſounds not; beſides it is vnknowne to vs, that the Papiſts take any offence at the Church it ſelfe, except we will beleeue your ſaying, which we haue no reaſon to doe in this controverſie,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:14577:225"/>
ſpecially, when theſe reſpects, on which you ſay ſo, we haue ſeene to be of no moments. Thirdly, ſhall we ſet the commandement of a Proteſtant Magiſtrate, and a Chriſtian maintainer of the Goſpell, behind the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the profeſſed enemies of the Church? Will you be ſo vnthankfull, where you are ſo much bound; and ſo kinde to thoſe to whom you proſeſſe the greateſt oppoſition? If you will not, why doe you talke of the offence of the Papiſts, and are not rather ſwayed with the commandement of the Magiſtrate? Alas brethren! ſhall we ſquare our obedience by the Papiſts humours? Verily then we ſhall performe none, for if they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nd ſuch a thing, they will pretend offence in all things that we may performe obedience in nothing. But I will not vrge this, becauſe I hope, you will be contented to yeeld of your old ſtreines for ſhame I ſay not, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, when you ſhall better conſider. Laſtly, the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, which you giue the Papiſte by ſtanding, and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and refuſing to kneele is greater, then the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of our kneeling. For, firſt, they are more perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible to enter into thoſe Churches, where ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence is vſed in receiving the Sacrament, then where it is not: and howbeit Gods word is effectuall to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Papiſts in thoſe places, where kneeling is not vſed, (as the Replier <note n="z" place="margin">Repl. gen. to Bp. <hi>Mort</hi> ch. 5.

                     <p>And why did the Replyer liſpe a truth ſo well known? for if there had beene nothing elſe which they diſliked, but kneeling at Sacrament, would they haue haue reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted vs for a falſe Church?

<pb n="438" facs="tcp:14577:233"/>
that the ſame humour is to bee found in many of them. For firſt, they which profeſſe in great reſolution with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grounds, or reaſons, that is, which meerely profeſſe in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Sixthly, in a word, they which haue confeſſed themſelues to be conuinced, that it is lawfull to kneele, and yet will not, or would but for their diſcredit in the world, ſpecially among the perſons of that ſide, are led by humour and preiudice. But (I aſſume) that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more manifeſt, then that many of your profeſſors are thus, and thus diſpoſed, and caried, which (if it ſhall concerne for Gods glory) I doubt not but I can particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly

maintaine ſo farre as outward expreſſions can diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the inward meaning, or purpoſe. Now I know you would not haue vs bound to abſtaine from kneeling for avoyding of the ſcandall of ſuch perſons. Yet I am not ſo ill conceited of you (brethren) but I aſſure my ſelfe there be among you, that ſtriue onely in this thing to follow the (perſwaded) direction of Gods word.

Yea of thoſe, who after refuſall of conformitie haue vpon riper iudgement yeelded vnto it, this Church hath had excellent lights to Gods glorie; when ſome of your Preachers perſiſting in their nonconformitie (as Maſter <note n="g" place="margin">In his Epi. to the Reader.</note>

If other Churches and perſons haue vſed a different geſture from ours, it followeth not therefore, that wee croſſe or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, iudge or cenſure any of them. There is a libertie of geſtures by Gods Word granted vnto the Church; and accordingly there hath euer beene, and euer will be great varietie in practiſe; yea in the ſame age, countrey, and perſon; and at the ſame ordinance. Wee are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore irregular to the Catholike Church in geſtures, whiles the rule allowes a libertie herein to all the members thereof, as circumſtances require. 2. Is it not true, that we doe varie from the iudgement and practiſe of the Catholike Church of Chriſt, in our particular geſture in controuerſie; nay it is contrarily true, that we doe not varie. For either particular Churches and perſons haue kneeled as well as we; or they haue vſed adoration in he art of receiuing, which is of the ſame kind with knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or they haue allowed kneeling in their profeſſed

iudgements, though according to the preſent time they haue practiſed ſome other geſture; or laſtly, they haue not condemned it, as being vnlawfull, and impious in its owne nature.</p>

preſent time, yet cannot ſpeake for ſcores and hundreds of yeeres afterward. Therefore if we bee able to giue you cuſtome for kneeling in the ancient Church, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented I pray, and ſhew your ſelues men of equity, in captiuating your wils to right reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Now concerning all theſe rules which you haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> for reſtraining of the queſtion, I requeſt (my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) leaue to admoniſh you of ſome things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that you cannot reaſonably limit the queſtion ſo much, if you but conſider how largely you haue ſpoken againſt the antiquitie of kneeling, for you <note n="i" place="margin">Diſp. to the Reader.</note> affirmed, that <hi>Antiquitie is wholly againſt vs, and the Primitiue Churches neuer ſo much as heard of kneeling, and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſucceeding excluded it out of their Congregations, and gaue no entertainment vnto it, for the ſpace of</hi> 1200. <hi>yeares.</hi> What are theſe but flouriſhes and vaunts, before the world to diſgrace our kneeling withall, which you will not ſtand to?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, you can much leſſe limit the queſtion, if <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> you conſider, that <hi>by any inſtance of kneeling or adoring ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures,</hi> our purpoſe is plentifully attained. For why doe you ſearch into the ancient Church in this controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, but partly to ſhew the conſent thereof againſt the practiſe of our Church, and partly to ſhew, that knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was not brought into the world, before the man of ſinne brought it in; and therefore you haue taken vpon you the proofe of a Negatiue, in theſe <note n="k" place="margin">Diſp. pag. 67, &amp;c.</note> words; That <hi>kneeling to receiue the Sacrament was not vſed at the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Lords Supper, nor after in any age of the Church, before the time of</hi> Honorius <hi>the third, about the yeere</hi> 1220. Now who doth not ſee, that one plaine inſtance of kneeling at Sacrament in the ancient Church quite ouerthrowes this great Negatiue; ſpecially if the ſame bee approoued by the writings of ſuch as were principall Doctours in the Church, for that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes the like and anſwerable allowance of multitudes, who were led vndoubtedly of them.</p>

                        <pb n="454" facs="tcp:14577:241"/>
Thirdly, you can leaſt of all limit the queſtion as you <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> doe, if you conſider, that by ſo doing you tye your ſelues in like manner vnawares; for according to your owne order we expect, that you ſhould prooue that <hi>ſitting was vſed</hi> for the firſt twelue hundred yeeres, and <hi>not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther geſture</hi> of the ſame kind; yea and that it was alſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely <hi>allowed</hi> and <hi>decreed</hi> in the Church. But alas, you bind a burden on our ſhoulders, without pitty, which would breake your owne backe, if you were put to it. Againe, giuing you the libertie of ſtanding (ſo farre as it is of the ſame kind with ſitting) to prooue vpon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your owne order, wee expect, that for the ages before the time of <hi>Honorius,</hi> you ſhall prooue that ſtanding was <hi>allowed</hi> and <hi>decreed</hi> by the Church at the Lords Supper<hi>:</hi> In all theſe things, both on your part and ours, what can be done, will (I ſuppoſe) in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree appeare by and by.

They ſaw not with the diſputers eyes, the doctrine of a Table-geſture was not then on foot.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides in the ſtrength of your owne opinion you do weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begge, that becauſe cuſtome and Councels had led the Church to ſtand at prayer, vpon a ſeuered reſpect, it was therefore abſurd, ſenſeleſſe, ridiculous, and againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to kneele at the Lords Supper: for if there was a fault, it was in prohibiting the geſture of kneeling on the Sabboth prayers, and not in practiſing the geſture of kneeling on the Sabboth Sacraments, which might lawfully be done, whether the other was or was not; and I pray you mind, that their ſtanding was vſed for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of Chriſts reſurrection, but the Sacrament is appointed for commemoration of his death. Alſo there appeares no reaſon out of the ancients, why they ſhould receiue the Sacrament in the ſame geſture, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they vſed to pray.</p>

That which <hi>Iuſtin</hi> ſpeakes here is of their maner on the Saboth daies when if they ſtood, it was in regard of the daie, as I haue anſwered before. 2. For other daies <hi>Iustin</hi> ſhewes a little before the reaſon why they called the Sacrament <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtia</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Non enim vt vulgarem panem, et vulgare poculum hoc ſumimus: for we vſe not to receiue it as common bread and wine.</hi> Which ſpeach may be both referred to their opinion of the conſecrated Bread and cup, that there was more in it then in common meales as alſo to their different manner of communicating. 3. But take your quotation, and read it over againe, and you find not a word of the Supper-geſture, and thinke you in ſo few words all the cariage in their aſſemblies in <hi>Iustins</hi> time is fully deſcribed? Beſides the word <hi>After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> brings in a ſeverall deſcription of the ſupper-em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, I ſay ſeverall from that which had preceded of rayper, how is it then poſſible to conclude, that the geſture was common? 4. Take your deſire, that the geſture of prayer was continued vnto the ſupper, true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yet the ſame might be kneeling for all that is ſaid here. For in this Church after exhortation of the word, we riſe vp (namely from ſitting,) and ſo go to prayer, and afterward we receiue, and yet notwithſtanding we kneele downe.

And if you adde any other teſtimony of moment, I wiſh I could haue informed the Reader, though I thinke there is none. But what ſhall be anſwered to this multitude? Verily this, that you goe about to outface vs with the authority of meere names and number, and abuſe vs as you haue abuſed your Authors. I aſſure the Reader, that none of all theſe teſtimonies (ſo farre as I can judge) I ſay not one of them ſimply condemns kneeling in the act of receiving: for <hi>either</hi> your ſaying of them is falſe, <hi>or</hi> elſe that which you quote out of them, ſpeakes only of ſtanding and ſitting, affirming them to be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent or lawfull without affirming kneeling to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, or delivers their opinions onely what geſture Chriſt and his Apoſtles did vſe at the Inſtitution, <hi>or</hi> els onely condemnes kneeling vnto the bread, or kneeling at firſt reformation for feare of Idolatry and ſcandall, <hi>or</hi> laſtly, this opinion of kneeling, that the Sacrament can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reverently received without it- If the Reader think it worth his labour, let him pleaſe to take the paines to examine whether I ſay true. It's cleere, that theſe learned then which you quote condemned not kneeling in it ſelfe, nay many of them were wont to
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:14577:260"/>
kneele at Sacrament in their owne practiſe. As for your arrogating, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is for you, is ſomewhat ſtrange. Suppoſe our religious Parliaments, Miniſters, people, reſtorers of religion haue deſired the remoovall of the bond of kneeling for the Churches quiet, do you think they condemned as vnlawfull there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that geſture, which themſelues haue beene wont and ſtill continue to vſe? but that you cannot thinke, except you thinke withall that they were all of them timeſervers and hypocrites. Noither is it diſparagement to our cauſe that other Churches vſe a different geſture from ours, for whiles we all agree in the ſubſtance, it is beſt for vs to vary in ſuch variable things, for the right vnderſtanding of them as they are. As for ſome oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they are parties with you in this preſent controverſie.
